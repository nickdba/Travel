## Prague Historic centre

### Trivia 1
Do you know what Prague is also called?  
a) The City of 100 spires  
b) The City on seven hills  
c) The City of lights  

The historic center of Prague with its atmosphere of medieval streets is reminiscent of old trade
routes, exquisite royal processions, knight tournaments and Hussite wars. Since 1992, it has been
included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Nowhere else will you find such a concentration of
historical landmarks and places where you can breathe in the history and romance of a time
gone by. There are few places where you can stop and rest in such beautiful landscaped gardens
and parks, and few places where you can walk along the same roads as the builder Petr Parléř
or the astronomers Tycho de Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart experienced
his greatest life achievements here. Franz Kafka wrote his most beautiful novels, and Rabbi Löw
created an artificial man called a Golem from clay.

Prague is historically divided into 4 parts, formerly separate cities, which differed not only in
their location but mainly in their population and position.

## Celetná Street / Celetná Ulice:

During the reign of one of the most prominent Czech and European rulers, Emperor Charles IV,
the importance of Celetna Street grew when it became part of the socalled Royal Way. The Royal
Powder Tower Way was a route through the city which Czech kings had to follow on the day of their coronation.
It leads from Vyšehrad – Prague’s second castle along Celetna Street, over the Old Town Square, along Karlova 
Street and across Charles Bridge up to Prague Castle, where the coronation would take place in the Cathedral of St Vitus.

The name of the Street is probably derived from the word Calty – a type of bread baked here in
the Middle Ages. Celetna Street is full of interesting and historically valuable buildings whose
foundations go back to the Gothic period. These structures then underwent Renaissance and then
mostly baroque reconstruction. Celetna Street is regarded as one of the highlights of Prague’s
architectural treasure trove. Some of its most noteworthy buildings are the House at the Black
Madonna, the Pachta Palace and the House of the Golden Angel.

### Municipal House / Obecní dům

Now you can see one of the most important buildings of Czech statehood. It was here that
an independent Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed on 28 October 1918. This was a ma-
jor event in modern Czech history, following on the reorganization of Europe after World War I
and the dividing of Austria-Hungary. The Municipal Building is a wonderful example
of Prague Art Nouveau. It was built by the Prague Municipality in 1905-1912. The aim was to
support the Czech social life and a feeling of Czech nationality, and thus create a counterpart
to the nearby German Building, where the German-speaking inhabitants of Prague met. Czech
and German-speaking populations led to long-standing national conflicts that often culminated 
in street battles in these places.

The Municipal Building was constructed as a representative building, both architecturally and
technically. You would find in them state-of-the-art equipment, unprecedented in Central Europe. 
For example, 28 electric and hydraulic lifts, air-conditioning with remote control, central vacuum 
cleaner and the largest electric organ in Austria-Hungary. For the first time there
was also the peak of progress - linoleum. Even the decoration of the Municipal Building
was magnificent. The most visible is the mosaic above the facade by Karel Špinar, called Hold
Prague and the Ladislav Šaloun sculpture The Humiliation and Resurrection of the Nation. 

You will find many other artistic representations of Czech history and art from the most important
Czech artists of the time e.g. Alfons Mucha, Mikoláš Aleš or J.V. Myslbek. And all this in the ex-
terior as well as in the incredible 1240 rooms within the Municipal Building. One of them
is the main Prague concert hall - the Smetana Hall. Here you can see the concerts of the
Prague Spring International Music Festival, held regularly since 1946.

### Trivia 2

Do you know why the gates are called Powder Gates?  
a) There was so much dust during the coronation processions, that almost covered the gate.  
b) They served as a storage for gunpowder.  
c) Alfréd Prach built it and his surname translate as dust.  

### Powder Tower / Prašná brána

The Powder Tower is one of the original 13 city gates in Old Town, Prague. Its construction began in 1475 
with the foundation stone placed by Vladislav II. It replaced the Přemyslid dynasty era gate in 1475 which
was a defensive tower. The new tower was intended to be an attractive entrance into the city and was built 
in the Gothic style by Matěj Rejsek as a gift from the Old Town to King Vladislav Jagiello.

Originally called the ‘Horska’ gate it acquired the name ‘Powder’ in the 17th century, when it was used
to store gunpowder (‘prašna’ coming from the word ‘prach meaning powder).
The appearance of the tower today dates back to 1875 - 76, when it was given a neo-Gothic makeover
by architect Josef Mocker. Sculptures representing the Czech kings adorn the tower – on the eastern side we find Přemysl
Otakar II and Charles IV and on the western side George of Poděbrady and Vladislav Jagiello.

### The Black Madonna House

The House at the Black Madonna is situated at the corner of Celetna Street and Ovocny trh. It
was built in 1911 – 1912 by architect Josef Gočar in the cubist style. With some exceptions, cubist
architecture is specific to the Czech lands and this building is one of the best examples.

Cubism uses geometrical shapes in its architecture. This comes from the architect’s conviction that
the basic geometrical form is the cube. The House at the Black Madonna was originally a multifunctional 
building with shops on the ground floor and offices, flats and the famous Orient coffee house with its 
cubist furniture on the floors above. At present the building is a national monument and houses a collection 
of Czech cubist paintings, furniture, sculpture and architects’ plans.
The name of the building comes from the Black Madonna house symbol on the corner, kept behind gold Renaissance bars.

## Basilica of ST. James / Kostel svatého Jakuba Většího

The Basilica of St James was originally a part of the Minorite Monastery and dates from the 13th century. 
In 1311 a feast to mark the coronation of King John of Luxemburg and Eliška of the Přemyslids was held here. 
After a fire in 1366 it was rebuilt in the Gothic style, but burnt down again in 1596 when it was hit by a lightning. 
Only at the end of the 17th century after yet another fire did it acquire its current baroque appearance. The basilica 
has excellent acoustics and concerts often take place here. The basilica also boasts a tremendous baroque organ from 1702. 
The creator of the stucco decoration on the church fasade is the Italan Ottavio Mosto. Above the main entrance visitors can see 
St Jacob in traditional pilgrim’s attire holding a stick.

There are 21 altars in the church made by such master craftsmen as Heinsch, Brandl and Reiner, whose painting called 
The Martyrdom of St James adorns the main altar. After the Cathedral of St Vitus, the Basilica of St James is the longest
church in Prague. In the left nave the baroque tomb of the Czech chancellor Vratislav of Mitrovice attracts most attention. 
It was designed by Jan Bernard Fischer of Erlach and decorated with sculptures by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff. It is regarded 
as the most attractive tomb in the Czech lands. Underneath the tomb is a crypt containing the tombs of the Earls of Mitrovice.
There is a well known legend associated with the tomb – the earl was buried alive by mistake and Basilica of St. James four 
years later, when the tomb was opened, his body was found in the sitting position trying in vain to lift the top off the tomb. 
In reality he died and was buried in Vienna.

On the main altar can see wooden statue of the Virgin Mary, a priceless piece from the 15th century. As legend would have it, 
this statue was always considered to have miraculous powers and people brought it all kinds of valuable gifts, even gold.

## Ungelt – Tyn Courtyard / Ungelt – Týnský dvur

A walled courtyard housing a customs post for merchants entering the Old Town was situated
here as early as the 12th century. Every merchant had to submit his goods and pay duty (um Geld – Geld is German for
Money, hence the name). In return the ruler would guarantee his safety. Customs duty was paid here until the end of 
the 16th century.

The original shape of the courtyard with two gates either end has remained. Around the Ungelt a hospital and church for 
the merchants were built and in 1135 a pharmacy was added, the oldest in Prague. In houses near the two gates to the courtyard 
one can still find remains of Romanesque houses in the cellars (at the turn of the 13th century, when Prague was experiencing huge 
problems with flooding, the whole of the Old Town was raised by 3.5 - 4m, meaning the ground floor of the buildings we see today 
would have been the first floor of Romanesque era structures). 

In the enclosed courtyard stands the Granovsky House, one of the best preserved Renaissance buildings in Prague. 
The loggia of the wing we can see from the courtyard is decorated with religious and mythical motifs.

## Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí)

Alongside Prague Castle the Old Town Square is the most important place in Prague. Its long history goes back to the 11th century 
when the square formed the crossroads of several longdistance trade routes and served as a marketplace. It was known across the 
whole of Europe at that time. Celebrations, jousting tournaments and executions took place there.

In 1321 King John of Luxemburg held a jousting tournament in the square, which he took part in himself. He was badly injured and 
for a long time his life hung in the balance. One of the most wretched events to take place in the square happened in 1621, 
at the beginning of the Thirty Years War, which affected the whole of Europe. 

27 Czech nobles, knights and burghers, leaders of an antiHabsburg revolt, were executed. The events of that day are commemorated 
by a plaque on the eastern side of the Old Town Hall. 27 crosses formed by cobblestones near the town hall mark the site where the 
executions took place. It is said that Emperor Ferdinand II, who had the rebellious Czechs decapitated, ordered drums to be beaten 
loudly during the execution so as not to hear the defiant cries  of the condemned. For instance Prokop Dvořicky of Olbramovice, 
before he went to his death, cried: „Tell the emperor that I now stand before his unjust court, but he will face a terrible and just one“. 

In 1945, as World War II was drawing to a close, fighting took place here during the Prague Uprising and the Old Town Hall was 
severely damaged. The Old Town Square is a national monument. The remains of some very old buildings have survived in the square. 
Even here the original ground level used to be 2 - 3m lower. This means that some of the present-day houses sit on the remains 
of Romanesque cellars. Many of these now house restaurants and winebars, a visit to which provides the opportunity to see these
medieval spaces. 

The houses in the Old Town Square are like a textbook of almost all architectural styles going. 
You’ll find Gothic, Renaissance and baroque elements, and on the south side of the square you’ll discover houses which still occupy
their medieval plots of land, evident from their narrow facades. Some of the most fascinating buildings on the square are the 
Kinsky Palace, The House at the Stone Bell, The Tyn School and the Štorch’s House. The names of houses here and throughout the 
medieval parts of the city are very often derived from a house symbol which can be found on the facade.

The most important buildings on the square: 
Golz-Kinsky Palace / Palác Golz Kinských, which visibly leads into the area of ​​the square, was built Old Town Sguare, 
Týn Temple was born here in 1843. In the 19th century, there was also a German grammar school, which was
attended by the world-famous writer Franz Kafka. The National Gallery is today located in the palace.

### Trivia 3

If you look near the monument of Master Jan Hus toward the ground, you will see
that the pavement is intersected by a mysterious line, ending with a gold plate.
What does it mean and what did it serve?  
a) The site of the Old Town gallows  
b) The meridian to which Prague time ran in the past  
c) The place where the plague column stood  

### Church of Our Lady before Týn / Týnský chrám

The Gothic Church of the Virgin Mary before Týn with its 80m high twin towers, of which the southernmost is noticeably thicker 
than the other, competes with the tower of the Old Town Hall across the square. The church was began in the 14th century
on the site of an original Romanesque chapel dating back to the 12th century, and it served as the church for foreign merchants
staying at the Ungelt.

During the Hussite wars the Tyn Church was the main place of worship for the Old Town and played an important role in the Hussite cause.
From 1427 Jan Rokycana, later elected as Hussite archbishop, served as a priest there. According to legend, in 1437 the timber meant for
the construction of the roof of the main Hussite church in Prague was used to build the gallows for the Hussite leader Jan Roháč z Dubé. 
20 years later the timber used to build the roof was to have been used for the stage at the wedding of King Ladislav Pohrobek. The young 
regent died just before his wedding day. 

The interior decoration of the Church dates chiefly from the 15th century. Visitors will find a Gothic stone pulpit, a Gothic tin font, 
statues of St John and the Virgin Mary and the statue of the Týn Madonna with Child, hich dates back to around 1420. The most beautiful 
stonework in the church is considered to be the canopy above the tomb of bishop Lucián of Mirandola by Matěj Rejsek (builder of the Powder Tower) 
from the end of the 15th century. We can also find statues by Jan Jiří Bendl and paintings by artists such as Škréta – the main altar of 
the Ascension of the Virgin Mary, the altar of St Barbora on the right and the Annunciation, St Vojtěch a St Joseph are all his works. 
In the south nave and on the altar of St Anne we find paintings by Brandl and on the third pillar in the church there is a carved Renaissance 
altar from around 1600.

One of the most celebrated works of art in theChurch is the tomb with a portrait of Tycho de Brahe, the world famous astronomist and 
astrologist who worked at the famous court of Rudolf II.
 
### House at the Stone Bell / Dům u kamenného zvonu

House at the Stone Bell / Dům U kamenného zvonu, on the south side of the square is perhaps the most attractive building in the Old Town
Square. It was probably the property of Queen Eliška of the Přemyslids, the wife of King John of Luxemburg and it was originally a 
Romanesque structure, proof of which are the 12th-century walls in the cellars.
In the early 14th century the house was transformed into a splendid Gothic Palace with two floors, Gothic halls and two chapels. 
Frescoes from the early 14th century have survived to this day, and in the parts of the ground floor accessible to the public the remains 
of the original carved stone decoration can be seen featu-ring a king and a queen on the throne and two armed figures Golz-Kinsky Palace
and House at the Stone Bell
The house gets its name from the obvious house symbol, a stone bell which protrudes out into the square from the corner of the building.
Today this is a replica of the bell. It’s generally thought that the bell serves as a reminder of the events of 1310, when Queen Eliška 
of the Přemyslid’s chaplain gave a signal to the army of King John of Luxemburg and his followers in the town to open the gates, avoiding 
the taking of the Old Town by force. In 1333 Charles IV stayed in the house when he found Prague Castle completely deserted and abandoned 
on his return to Prague from France and Italy.

### House of the White Unicorn / Dům u bílého jedno-rožce. 

This house is rebuilt in the Gothic and Renaissance style, and in the late 18th century it acquired a late Baroque façade. Beneath the 
corner of the house there is a Romanesque room from the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. Josefina Dušková was born here, the well-known 
girlfriend of music composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

### House of Štorch / Štorchův dům. 

The house is known for its painted facade, dating from 1896-1897. The paintings on the facade were created according to the cartouche of 
the prominent Czech painter Mikoláš Aleš. The dominant feature of the painting is the equestrian figure of St. Wenceslas. He sits on a 
white horse and holds a banner in his hand. St. Wenceslas is one of the patrons of the Czech nation and acts as its protector. 

The ornamental plant under the hooves of the horse complements the signs of the St. Wenceslas eagle and the Czech lion. 
A bird circles above a tree a symbol of the freedom of the Czech nation, and the lizard, which represents the enemies of state autonomy,
attempting to climb out in vain.

### Trivia 4

The Turk of Prague is one of the most famous spirits of the Old Town. Do you know what crime he committed and why he must haunt?  
a) He killed the royal armorer  
b) He scoffed at the priest from the nearby Tyn Church  
c) Killed the daughter of the innkeeper to whom he was betrothed and who, during his stay in Turkey, married someone else  

### Jan Hus Monument (Pomník mistra Jana Husa)

The memorial of Master Jan Hus commemorates the significant Czech religious reformer. It stands on the northern side of the Old Town Square.
This sculpture by sculptor Ladislav Šaloun from 1915 represents two groups of people - the first are the Hussite fighters, the second 
the Protestants, forced into exile for about 200 years. 
A sloping line of evenly laid paving blocks can be seen near the memorial. It shows where the Prague meridian (14° 30' longitude) passes.

Master Jan Hus (1371 – 1415) A prominent Czech religious reformer who criticised the Church at a time when Europe was heading into religious 
turmoil due to the papal schism. Hus was born in the small village of Husinec in South Bohemia, graduated from the Theological 
Faculty of Prague University, and later became its rector. At the time he was one of the greatest thinkers in Europe. He preached in the 
Bethlehem Chapel about putting right problems which had developed in the Church, and about returning the Church to its original beliefs 
such as modesty and recognising the bible as the single religious text. He criticised corruption in the Church, rife at the time, 
and wrote many works on reforming the Church which later formed the basis for the reform movement in Germany under Martin Luther.
Hus soon brought the wrath of the pope in Rome upon himself, and was excommunicated. Even though for a long time he was under direct 
protection of King Wenceslas IV., who also had his grievances with the state of the Church, he was forced to leave Prague in 1412. 
In 1414 he was invited to appear before the church Church Council in Constance, where he would be given the opportunity to defend his thoughts. 
But Hus’s fate was decided by the council long before he arrived and he was declared a heretic in 1415 and burnt at the stake.

### Old Town Hall (Staroměstská radnice)

The Old Town Hall was founded in 1338. It is comprised of 5 individual houses which were gradually joined together into one building. 
The dominating feature of the Old Town Hall is its 69.5m high tower dating from the late 14th century, with an ornate oriel window, part of the
chapel, on the eastern side. On the southern side of the tower we find the famous Astronomical Clock, created by Mikulaš of Kadaně in 1410.
According to the legend, when the Astronomical Clock was finished, the councillors had Mikulaš of Kadaně’s eyes put out so that he couldn’t 
repeat the feat in another city. 

The Astronomical Clock can be divided into three sections: The first section contains the small windows, at which every hour the 12 apostles 
appear and bow to the waiting crowds. Every apostle holds his symbol: St Peter has a key, St Matthew an axe, St John a chalice and so on. 
Four figures directly underneath also spring into action when the apostles appear. The skeleton inverts his hourglass and rings a bell to 
let us know that our lives are at an end; the Turk, a symbol of a comfortable life, nods his head but then shakes it refusing death. 
The figure representing Vanity looks in the mirror and the Miser shakes his purse full of money. At the end of the show the cockerel 
crows marking the beginning of another hour of this life The second section is called the upper face and shows the movement of the planets. 
Naturally, this represents an old way of thinking with the planets and the Sun circling a stationary Earth. At the very bottom is the 
calendarwheel, where in addition to the coat of arms of the Old Town, the signs of the zodiac and the months of the year represented by motifs
from rural life are depicted. Around the edge of the wheel are 365 notches; the wheel turns one notch each day taking a whole year to make one 
full turn. 

The Astronomical Clock also shows four times: Central European time shown with Roman numerals around the edge of the upper face; Old Bohemian time 
is shown with gold Gothic  numbers (according to this method of time keeping, the day begins at sunset); Babylonian time where the hours are much
longer in the summer than in winter; and celestial time shown by a small star on a rod extending from the zodiacal cross. The 2nd floor interiors
of the town hall are of particular historical interest. Here the original Gothic council chamber has survived. The large chamber is decorated
with pictures by Vaclav Brožik. In the late Gothic Jiřik’s Chamber visitors will find the remnants of murals from the end of the 15th century. 

Just like every medieval town hall, the Old Town Hall used to have a prison. Prisoners were lowered down into their own private cell, a hole in the
ground which was then filled in with stone. Prisoners were, in essence, buried alive.

### Church of St Nicholas (Kostel sv. Mikuláše)

The Church of St Nicholas was originally a Gothic building and served as the parish church of the Old Town before the Tyn Church was built. 
Following the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620, and during the Counter Reformation in the Czech lands, the church was taken over by Benedictine monks.

In1732 - 1735 it was then rebuilt in the baroque style by Kilian Ignac Dienzenhofer. The entrance to the church faced the Jewish Town and so did
not have to be particularly decorative. The side of the church faces the Old Town Hall. For this reason the side of the building is richly decorated, 
creating the impression that this is the main entrance. The decoration on the side was designed to be looked at from close up, evident from the way 
the statues (created by Antonin Braun) are leaning over. The interior of the church is full of intricate stucco work by Bernardo Spinetti. Petr Assamo 
painted the pictures which adorn the dome, the presbytery and the side chapels. These paintings show scenes from the life of St Nicholas and St Benedict. 

It is hard not to notice the huge crownshaped chandelier, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II. In 1787 as part of Emperor Josef II’s religious reforms, almost 
all the monasteries and many churches that did not provide a service for the community, were closed.
The Church of St Nicholas was not spared and after the closure was used by the military. During a later war, the then commader of the Prague garrison 
had the decoration in the church restored by artsist who otherwise would have been sent to the front. After the creation of Pařižska Street the eastern
corner of the church was completed and in 1906 a recess holding a statue of St Nicholas and a neoclassical fountain with dolphins were added.
After World War I the church was once again used for its original purpose by the Hussite Church. 

### Franz Kafka (1883 – 1924)

The building joined on to the church in Kafka Square stands on the site of the former Benedictine Monastery. The house bears a plaque reminding us that 
this is the birthplace of the famous Czech author (who of course wrote in German), Franz Kafka.

Franz Kafka is one of the most widely known and ce-lebrated writers of the 20th century. He is known above all for his novels The Trial, America and 
The Castle. Kafka came from a Jewish family and grew up at a time when ethnic conflicts began to escalate in Prague, a fact evident in his work. 
As mentioned earlier, Kafka was born in the former Benedictine Monastery next to the Church of St Nicholas and spent most of his life in the
Old Town. Kafka’s family lived, for instance, in the House U minuty, part of the Old Town Hall and in Celetna Street. The young Kafka also attended the
German Grammar School in the Kinsky Palace. In the course of his life in Prague, Kafka became acquainted with the elite of the Prague literary
world such as Franz Werfel, Max Brod and the Kirsch brothers. In 1915 he won his first literary prize for a short story called The Stoker. 
In 1916 – 17 he worked in the Golden Lane at Prague Castle, but had already been diagnosed as having tuberculosis. At the end of his life Kafka 
left Prague and died of tuberculosis in 1924 in Kierling near Vienna.

The House at the Minute is an intricate and historic home originating from the 15th century where Kafka lived from 1889 to 1896.

## Prague Jewish Town / Pražské Židovské město

Prague’s Jewish community has a history going back a very long way indeed. Jewish merchants and money lenders were settling in Prague as early as the
10th century. The original community in the Malá Strana moved in the middle of the 12th century to Josefov. Throughout its existence, the Jewish 
community was confined to clearly marked areas which it could not leave. At the height of its development, 1,900 people were crammed into 93,000m2.

From the outset the Jewish population of Josefov set up its own administration and had its own schools and synagogues. The synagogues were the
most important places in the ghetto. In medieval times they weren’t only places of worship but also places where Jewish teachers met their pupils.
Before the Jewish Town had its own town hall, all public matters were settled in the synagogues too. Over the course of their history the Jews suffered
numerous pogroms. The first is recorded as having happened in 1096 when the first army of crusaders was passing through the city. 

In 1389 another large pogrom took place in the Jewish ghetto, which the young Avigdor Kara, a future Prague Rabbi, experienced at first hand. He wrote
of what he saw in his Selichot remorseful prayers still read today on days of atonement around the world. The status of Prague’s Jews improved slightly
in 1781, when Emperor Josef II issued his socalled ‘Toleration Act’, which gave the Jewish population access to schooling. In 1848 Jews were given the 
same rights as everybody else and for the first time in history they were allowed to move out of the ghetto. These reforms meant that almost all the rich 
Jewish families moved out of the ghetto and poor Czech families moved in. Gradually the ghetto began to deteriorate and become a dangerous, rundown area. 

At the end of the 19th century the situation in the ghetto had become so bad (for instance, rooms in some old houses were divided up into smaller rooms 
with a chalk line or a curtain, and each room was inhabited by a whole family), that the Prague authorities decided to demolish it to prevent the spread 
of illness. Some 300 medieval houses and 20 streets were wiped off the map. After this, only a small part of the original ghetto remained today’s
Jewish Town – Josefov.

Tickets can be bought from the museums of the Pinkas Synagogue, Klausen Synagogue or the Spanish synagogue.
Open each day from 9am to 6pm except Saturday.

### Trivia 5

Do you know where the Golem of Prague is hiding according to legend?  
a) At the site of the Old Synagogue  
b) In the Old Jewish Cemetery  
c) He is not hiding, but walks regularly through the streets of the Jewish Quarter and catching thieves

### Pinkas Synagogue / Pinkasova synagoga

This synagogue was established by Rabbi Pinkas in the late 15th century as part of a house called U Erbů. The Pinkas Synagogue has been rebuilt
several times as the building was the victim of several floods. During the last archeological digging here, remnants of a medieval ritual bath (a Mikva)
were discovered. Today the interior of the synagogue with its Gothic vaulted ceilings is a monument to the victims of the holocaust. The walls
are covered from floor to ceiling with the names of more than 77 thousand Jews from Bohemia and Moravia, who were murdered by the Nazis.

### Old Jewish Cemetery / Starý židovský hřbitov

The Old Jewish Cemetery, adjacent to the Klaus Synagogue, is called Bethchaim (The House of Life) by the Jews themselves, and it is a place of great 
significance around the world. It is not known exactly when the cemetery was established, but the oldest gravestone found there bears the date April 25, 1439
and belongs to the well known scholar and poet, Avigdor Kara, who described the pogrom of 1389. Burials took place in the cemetery continuously until 1787,
when it was closed. As the Jewish community for centuries had just one cemetery at its disposal, crammed in between the houses, and as Jews were not allowed
to dig up the bones of the dead, they began to bury people one on top of the other in layers. It’s estimated that the cemetery holds 12 thousand gravestones
and 80 thousand graves in 12 layers. The gravestones show the name’s of the deceased as well as many other interesting clues about his or her life.

Many gravestones bear verse’s and emblems symbolising names, occupations and traditional clans. Some of the best known symbols are hands giving a blessing, 
signifying that the deceased belonged to the Aron tribe (Kohen) of priests; the Hebrew name Dob means bear, a kettle is the symbol of the Levi family, a mouse 
signifies the Maisel family and so on. Unlike the majority of Jewish cemeteries, we find reliefs depicting human forms. These are somewhat imperfect, intentionally 
so, as the stonemasons did not want tobreak the holy law forbidding the depiction of people (it was considered as an arrogant attempt to imitate God’s work).

### Klausen  Synagogue (Klausova synagoga)

Before we begin with the tour of the synagogue, we ought to clarify why it takes the name „Klausen”. It can be explained in two ways. According to the first 
version, the name is derived from the German word “Klause” a small building. The other interpretation refers to three clauses, i.e. three functions – the synagogue, 
a hospital and a bathhouse. The original synagogue was built on an additionally purchased plot in 1573 by then Czech Primate Mordecai Meisel (czech: Mordechaj Maisel), 
however it succumbed to great fire in 1689. Thanks to Solomon Chalis Cohen a new tabernacle was built in 1694 and it became the largest and the Klaus Synagogue second 
major synagogue of Prague Jewish Community. The building underwent further reconstruction in 1880s.

The major feature of the synagogue is a richly stucco decorated vault. The synagogue consists of a main building and two annexes. As you could have already noticed, 
nearly all windows have semicircular finish. Unfortunately, the original Baroque vaults preserved just in the main hall. Please, look at the east face where you can see 
a distinctive and interesting element a triangular gable with Commandment Tablets at the post and an inscription tablet from the late 17th century. Regrettably, religious
service is not held here at present, nevertheless, the synagogue houses a permanent exhibition of Jewish Museum called Jewish Customs and Traditions.

### Jewish Ceremonial Hall – Building of Prague Burial Society

The Ceremonial hall of the Prague Jewish Burial Society was built for the last service to the deceased members of the Prague Jewish Community. It is used as an exhibition space administered by the Jewish Museum in Prague. The building is an excellent example of Romanesque Revival architecture.

The present Ceremonial Hall has replaced an older building serving the same purpose. It was constructed by A. Gabriel and J. Gerstel between 1906 and 1908. Its appearance, including the details like the bases and capitals of columns, the grille and the door, holds to the Romanesque Revival style. As long as the Prague chevra kadisha (Jewish Burial Society) used the space, the morgue was in the basement, on the first floor there was a room for the ritual purification of the dead (taharah) and on the second floor there was a meeting room, where the Society held its meetings as well as annual banquets. Since World War I the Burial Society has not used the hall for its original purpose. In 1926 the Society rented the building to the Jewish Museum in Prague, which has used it ever since.

The exposition which was opened there at the time is linked with the original usage of the space, introducing visitors to Jewish rituals held over the dying and the deceased (thus the exposition about the important milestones of Jewish life from the Klausen Synagogue is continued there), providing them with information about the Old Jewish Cemetery and other cemeteries in the Czech lands and the institution of the Prague Jewish Burial Society.

An important monument left by the Burial Society to posterity is a cycle of fifteen paintings, depicting rituals and customs performed by the Burial Society. An anonymous author fulfilled the order of the Society from around the year 1772 and followed the Baroque painting style. However, the motive of the Society, which hired him, originated probably from the new, enlightened, age: in keeping with the enlightened ideology it was supposed to show an important social role, which the Society had maintained for centuries. The paintings also depict the final period of the history of the Old Jewish Cemetery which makes the cycle more valuable.

### Old New Synagogue (Staronová synagoga)

The Old-New Synagogue dating back to the late 13th century used to be the Jewish community’as main place of worship. It is one of the oldest and most beautiful Gothic buildings in Prague, and the oldest synagogue in Europe. It is made up of a doublenaved hall divided by pillars on which rests unique fiveribbed vaulting. In the centre of the synagogue stands 
the pulpit behind a 15thcentury iron grille and surrounded by pews for eminent members of the Jewish community. Notice pew number one, above which is the Star of David. It was here
that the legendary Rabbi Low, creator of the Golem, used to sit. The most important place in the whole Synagogue is the bimah which faces east and contains the Torah – the five books 
of Moses. For Jews, the Torah is something sacred; those who read from it may not touch it with their hands, but use a silver pointer instead. At the beginning of the 14th century
an entrance hall was added to the synagogue housing two treasuries for tax collectors. Both brick gable ends were also added at this time. To pass from the entrance hall into the
main hall of the synagogue one goes through one of the oldest entrances in Prague. 

The tympanum (space above the entrance) is decorated with a relief of vine leaves and grapes. This decoration symbolises the 12 tribes of Israel as branches of one bush. This 
synagogue is steeped in legends. The most famous of these, the subject of several films, is the Golem a monster created by Rabbi Bezael Low. The Golem was made of clay and did all 
the work in the rabbi’s household. Rabbi Low brought him to life by placing a small roll of parchment with a sacred text written on it called a Shem under the Golem’s tongue, 
after which he acquired enormous strength and inexhaustible energy. He remained in that state until the Shem was removed. The Old-New Synagogue is the only synagogue in Prague where services still take place.

### High Synagogue and Jewish  Town Hall (Vysoká synagoga a Židovská radnice)

The High Synagogue, which can be found directly opposite the Old-New Synagogue, was built at the same time as the Jewish Town Hall next door by Mordechai Maisel in the second half of the 16th century. The Italian architect Pankrac Roder designed the building. The High Synagogue was originally linked to the town hall by an entrance on the 1st floor, and served as a meeting place for the Jewish community and representatives of the Jewish Town. However, this entrance was bricked up at the end of the 19th century and a new one created in Červena Street. The Renaissance building now houses an exhibition of 16th - 19th century synagogue textiles from the Jewish Museum.

### Maisel Synagogue (Maiselova synagoga)

The Maisel synagogue was erected in 1592 on the basis of a privilege granted by Emperor Rudolf II. Its founder was Mordecai Maisel, the Mayor of the Prague Jewish Town.

Built by Judah Tzoref de Herz and Josef Wahl, it was 

The construction of the synagogue was initiated by Mordechai Maisel, the Mayor of the Prague Jewish Town. In 1590, this renowned businessman and benefactor of the ghetto gained the building site. One year later he obtained from the emperor Rudolf II, the current sovereign of the country, a privilege to build his own synagogue. Mordecai Maisel had an important position at Rudolf's court and that probably helped him to gain this favour. The architectural plan for Maisel synagogue, designed by Judah Coref de Herz, was realized by Josef Wahl 
as a Renaissance temple with three naves, which was unusual for its day. In 1592, on Simchat Torah, the synagogue was consecrated. For the next century it became the largest and most impressive building in the ghetto, also thanks to its abundant equipment. Maisel bequeathed the synagogue to the Prague Jewish community, yet after his death in 1601 all his 
possession, including the synagogue, was confiscated (in spite of another imperial privilege, allowing Maisel to write a testament). Maisel's last will was therefore fulfilled 
entirely only after a number of trials, several decades later.

In 1689 the synagogue was severely damaged by fire that affected the whole ghetto. It was reconstructed in a hurry and lost one third of its length. Then it was changed in the 19th century (in 1862–1864 according to architectural plan of J. W. Wertmüller) and again at the turn of the 20th century when all the Jewish Quarter went through a big urban renewal. Architect Alfred Grotte reconstructed the synagogue in Neo-Gothic style.

During the Nazi occupation of the Czech lands, properties of the Czech Jewish communities were stored in Maisel Synagogue. After the World War II the synagogue became a depository of Jewish Museum in Prague. During the sixties it was restored and between 1965 and 1988 an exposition of silver Judaica was located there. Then the synagogue was closed because of deplorable technical conditions, which could not be improved because of lack of financial means. Velvet revolution made necessary reconstruction possible and the synagogue was then opened for visitors in 1996, showing an exposition of Jewish history in the Czech lands from the beginning (9th century) till the age of Enlightenment which meant a turning point in Jewish social status. After the recent restoration of Maisel Synagogue, this exposition has been updated (modern and interactive elements added), its topic, however, has remained the same.

### Spanish Synagogue(Španělská synagoga)

The youngest synagogue of the Prague´s Jewish Town Josefov was built at the crossroads of the streets Dušní and Vězeňská between 1867-68. Just like some other synagogues this one
was built in the Moorish style according to the project of Ignác Ullmann and Josef Niklas. The construction was performed in place of the former oldest synagogue called The Old School
or „Templ“ which according to the extant historical sources existed already in the 12th century. It was called „school“ because the synagogues used to serve as educational institutes
for the inhabitans of the Jewish community. And why is it actually called „Spanish“? There was an expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Isabella of Castile in the 15th century and
after their departure from their original homeland a small part of them settled down in Prague. They received the mentioned school to be their sanctuary which got the name „the Spanish synagogue“ after being settled by the Spaniards.

The synagogue itself is two storeys high. Its ground plan is square. The main hall with a dome is surrounded by three built-in balconies. At the south balcony, there is an organ. In the eastern wall there is a great round stained glass window with a central ornament of Magen David (hexagram), installed in 1882–1883. Underneath it there is a monumental aron ha-kodesh (Torah ark). The most impressive decorative element in the synagogue is a gilded and multi-colored parquet arabesque.

## Lucerna Passage

From its inauguration in 1921 until the present day, Lucerna has been an important cultural and social centre of the national capital, 
both in the former Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic, hosting concerts, balls, conferences, fashion shows, and sporting events. 
Over time, some of the most prominent local and international artists have performed at the venue.
It features David Černý's statue Kůň, hanging piano, music hall and cinema entrances.
Roof top open from 16:00-22:00 Friday, Saturday and Sunday.


## The Rudolfinum / Rudolfinum

The Rudolfinum was constructed between 1876 – 1881. The contemporary Jan Palach Square was determined to be the right place for that exceptional building. The construction was performed
under direction of architects Josef Zítek and Josef Schulz. They created a unique neorenaissance building that due to its opulence and grandiosity could not be used for any other but representative purposes. In honour of the successor of the Habsbourg throne, Archduke Rudolf, the building was called the Rudolfinum. The Rudolfinum was mainly used for important cultural events, concerts and exhibitions. There are nearly one thousand rooms behind the walls of the Rudolfinum.

Richly decorated exhibition spaces are accompanied by representative chambers. However, let´s peep into the most prestigious part of the Rudolfinum. It is the so-called Dvořákova síň (Dvo-řák Hall) which due to its gorgeous decorations and perfect acoustics became the scene of the most important concerts and social events. They are performed either at Suk or Kubelík Hall. At present the building is a residence of the Czech Philharmonic and the Rudolfinum Gallery.

## Manes Bridge / Mánesův most

And now we are heading to the second Vltava bank over the Mánes Bridge. This one hundred and eightysix foot and sixteen meter wide bridge opened in 1914. Until then, the people of Prague only used a footbridge. The bridge was named after the famous Czech painter Josef Mánes, whom we consider to be the founder of 19th century Czech national painting. Mánes was an   excellent portraitist, landscaper and illustrator. You have already seen his work on Old Town Square in the Orloj, for which he created the Prague Astronomical Clock with scenes of rural life.

From the Mánes Bridge you can also see a large section of old Prague on the opposite left bank of the Vltava River. From the most interesting places you can see Prague Castle with the  St. Vitus Cathedral, on the right side of the bridge the building of the Strako Academy, today’s Office of the Government. On the left side Hergetova Cihelna, a former tannery, Vojanovy Meadows, nowadays a landscaped garden suitable for rest. The famous Charles Bridge, after which we will return on our route to the right bank of Vltava and a forested hill, reminiscent of a table top mountain - Petřín with its lookout tower, a replica of the Paris Eiffel Tower and a beautiful view of Prague 

## Trivia 1

Do you know from what royal dynasty was the Roman Emperor and the Czech King Charles IV? (1310 – 1378)?
a) The Přemyslids  
b) Luxembourg  
c) Habsburgs  

## Straka Academy / Strakova akademie

From the Manes Bridge you can see Straka Academy on the right.
The academy building grew in these quarters between 1891 – 1896. Originally, the building was used as a student´s hostel, especiallyfor poor sons of Bohemian noble families. The design
of the building was the work of a significant architect Václav Roštlapil. A complex of buildings with the total area of 4000 square metres with a garden with another 17 000 square metres grew within 5 years in there. Should we just after the finishing of the works look inside we could see the study rooms, administrative offices of the academy, further the reception room and the cabinets with large collections of learning utilities in the ground floor. The two top floors were reserved for students. The study rooms, dormitories and a domestic chapel could be found there. Surprisingly, there was even central heating in the building and the students could use a spa with a swimming pool, the premises also involved both summer and winter gyms and a fencing room, too. You could even find a hospital in the premises, too. After the Academy operated for two years a CzechGerman Gymnasium was founded here, too. In the period of WW1 the Academy fell under the organization of the Red Cross. The Red Cross founded a hospital in the premises with the capacity of 470 beds. The main assembly hall of the Straka Academy turned into a giant operating theatre and the higher floors were occupied by patients instead of students. The hospital was cancelled in 1918. The independent Czechoslovakia was founded at that time and the new republic used the premises of the academy for offices and state needs. 
The building turned into the residence of the protectorate government after the formation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After WW2 the building served for the purposes of the government again. The Czech Government Office has been residing in the building of the Academy since 1993.

## Kafka Museum

The Franz Kafka Museum (Czech: Muzeum Franze Kafky) in Prague is dedicated to the author Franz Kafka. The museum hosts a number of first edition Kafka books.

The exhibition features copies of manuscripts as well as photographs and personal documents, but no originals. It includes correspondence between Kafka and writer Milena Jesenská. Some of the explanatory texts are hardly readable, because they are located on transparent surfaces with exhibits in the same color as the letters. All texts are in English, some - mainly quotations - also in Czech and German. The impression therefore is that the museum is made mainly for foreign tourists rather than people from the Czech Republic. There are two permanent exhibitions: one explores Prague's influence on Kafka's work, and the other focuses on how Kafka describes Prague in his writing.

The museum features strange and absurd design elements that are inspired by Franz Kafka's unusual ideas. The space is dark and has special elements such as a long, red-lit staircase and mysterious sound effects. Outside the museum is an exhibit called Piss, a bronze fountain of two men urinating into a lake shaped like the Czech Republic. It was created by Czech sculptor David Černý in 2004.

## Lennon’s Wall

When you continue along our route, you will go next to a place famous for most visitors - around the “Lennon’s Wall”. This brightly painted wall has become a reminder of the tragic end of John Lennon at the beginning of the 1980s. The wall with a portrait of a legendary artist soon became a place where people expressed their views and protests against the communist regime. Even at the cost of police repression. And this tradition continues now.


## Trivia 2

Do you remember from which Prague bridge St. John of Nepomuk was dropped into the Vltava?  
a) From the Main Bridge  
b) From the Czech Bridge  
c) From Charles Bridge  

## Kampa Island / Kampa

Kampa Island is one of the most idyllic and tranquil places in the Czech capital. The island is divided into two visibly distinct parts. The section nearest to Charles Bridge is formed by a small, cosy square; the second is a park, formed when several historical gardens were joined together. Kampa was first mentioned in the late 12th century, when the island was given over to the Johannine Monastery. For centuries the island was a victim of regular flooding, thanks to which its shape was in constant flux. This situation changed after the fire of 1541
when Kampa was shorn up with rubble from the burntout buildings. Kampa is divided from the Mala Strana by a channel of the Vltava known as the Čertovka. It is said the name (which comes from the Czech word for ‘demon’) comes from a woman who owned a mill there. As she was so successful, and unusually for the time ran the mill herself, people began to think that she was in league with the Devil.

Until the mid 16th century the island was practically deserted except for three watermills. Today visitors can still see two mill wheels. In the 16th century the island was settled by craftsmen responsible for the upkeep of Charles Bridge.

You can take a break at the Mlýnská kavárna (coffeshop)

## Museum Kampa

Museum Kampa is a modern art gallery in Prague, Czech Republic, showing Central European, and in particular Czech work. The pieces are from the private collection of Meda Mládek, wife of Jan V. Mládek. The museum opened in 2003 and is housed in the Sova's Mills on the eastern bank of the Kampa Island on the River Vltava.

There is a large sculpture of a chair by Magdalena Jetelová outside the museum, which is a prominent landmark visible from across the Vltava.

## Charles Bridge

### Lesser Town Bridge Towers / Malostranské mostecké věže mark 

The Lesser Town Bridge Towers end of Charles Bridge on the Lesser Town side. These two towers, unlike the tower on the Old Town side, were never decorated. The smaller of the two has survived from the days of Judith Bridge, when it was part of the defence system. It got its Renaissance overcoat in the 16th century. Rare Romanesque reliefs have survived on the walls depicting a ruler on the throne and a figure on his knees. The larger tower was built in 1464 during the reign of King George of Poděbrady. On this tower there are symbols relating to the reign of Wenceslasa IV, as it was originally intended to mimic the Old Town Bridge Tower, the proof of which are the empty recesses on the facade. An interesting fact about the tower is that on the battlements there is one empty space where a stone is missing. According to chroniclers, the stone fell out when ravens sat on it. The stone landed on the head of King Wenceslasa’s favourite knight when he was returning to Prague after a battle. The knight is said to have been valiant and courageous, and had been through many battles without a scratch. Now he had died from a stone dislodged by ravens hitting him on the head. In his memory the king never had the stone replaced.

### Charles Bridge

See the statue map.
Charles Bridge replaced Judith Bridge which had spanned the Vltava since the late 12th century. Judith Bridge was the longest in central Europe (514m long) 
until it was swept away in a flood in 1342. It was Charles IV’s idea to build a new bridge (originally called simply the Stone Bridge). The first stone was laid in 1357. Charles IV. was concerned whether the new bridge would be built properly so that it dd not meet the same fate as its predecessor. He therefore ordered raw eggs to be mixed into the mortar to make it
stronger. A study has shown that Petr Parleř, the builder of the bridge, did indeed add raw eggs as well as wine to the mortar! The striking feature of the bridge, 520m span and 95m wide roadway is the gallery of 30 mostly baroque statues which date from the 17th, and to a lesser extent, the 19th century, by leading artists of the day (F. M. Brokoff, M. B. Braun, M. V. Jaeckl for example). The oldest statue is the bronze knight called Bruncvik with a lion that stands on a plinth on Kampa Island. The second oldest is the statue of the Holy Cross on the third pillar as one heads from the Old Town Bridge Tower). A Hebrew inscription celebrating the Almighty is draped around the cross. On the penultimate pillar on the right stands the famous Turk guarding a cave where Christi ans have been imprisoned. This is part of a group of statues representing St. John of Matha, St. Felix of Valois and St. Ivan. Another well known statue is that of St. John of Nepomuk, and about halfway along the bridge is a relief showing this saint being cast from the bridge. The last statue representing St. Cyril and Methodius was only installed here in 1938. In the Middle Ages jousting tournaments used to take place on Charles Bridge. Dishonest bakers would be dunked into the icy waters of the Vltava in a special cage from one of the ledges on the bridge.

### Old Town Bridge Tower / Staroměstská mostecká věž 

The old town bridge tower is regarded as one of the most attractive medieval towers in the city. On one side it borders on Křižovnicke Square and forms the gateway to Charles Bridge.
The tower was begun during the reign of Charles IV.and formed a part of the Old Town’s defence’s. The tower’s creator was the celebrated Prague architect,who also worked on the Cathedral of St Vitus at Prague Caste, Petr Parleř. The Old Town Bridge Tower is decorated with many pieces of sculpture. On the east side we see rulers Charles IV. on the right and Wenceslas IV on the left, during whose reigns the tower was built. Between them stand the patron saints of the Czech lands, St. Vit and above him St. Zikmund and St. Vojtěch. On the side of the tower Petr Parléř had the Latin inscription made which reads: SIGNA-TESIGNATEMERE METANGISETANGIS („Be told, be told and watch out; he who touches me, dies“). The inscription is a palindrome in Latin. The importance in the Middle Ages, and in particular the reign of Charles IV., of symbolism is indicated by the moment when the foundation stone for the tower was laid: year 1357, 9th July, at 5:31 (135797531, another palindrome). In the same vein, the tower is divided into four ‘spheres’. The first is the Earth and the second the Moon decorated with 28 crabs (28 day cycle of the moon). Above the Moon is the Sun’s sphere (symbolising royal and imperial might), and the fourth is the celestial sphere, symbolised by statues of the saints.
The tower also features symbols of the lands belonging to the Czech Crown. The western side of the tower is much plainer. Facing the length of the bridge is it was open to attacks (for instance in 1648, when the Swedes laid siege to Prague – these events are commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the tower dating back to 1650). The tower was for a while used as
a prison for debtors and to this day one can still see grafitti scribbled by prisoners on the walls inside. The steps up into the tower ascend to floors from which there are stunning views of the bridge and Hradčany.

###  Krizovnicke Square / Křižovnické náměstí

As soon as you pass under the Old Town Bridge Tower you will reach the small Knights of the Cross Square. On the left side of the square you can see the Church of St. Francis of Assisi, before you the facade of the Church of the Most Holy Savior belonging to the large complex of Clementium and you will surely not miss the statue of Charles IV. Church of St. Francis of Assisi / Kostel sv. Františka z Assisi is closely connected with the only originally Czech Christian order of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, established by St. Agnes, the abbess of the Convent of Agnes, already described as a hospital brotherhood. The Order was recognized by Pope Gregory IX as early as 1237 and its sign is a red cross with a six-pointed star. And because they were purely hospital order, they settled in the same way as the Johanites on the other Vltava bank by the river. In the hospital, it was always very important to have plenty of clean water and the church of St. Francis was truly connected with an important hospital. It probably saved it from burning at the time of the Hussites. The church and the hospital were the most damaged in 1648 in battles against the Swedes. From the monastery windows at that time, they shot at the attacking Swedes, trying not to let them pass over Charles Bridge to the Old Town. This eventually succeeded, the Knights of the Cross losing their master at the time, hit by bullets, but the Swedes left Prague, though with a large part of the valuable treasures from Prague Castle and the Lesser Town Churches. 

The Order grew further, in the 16th and 17th centuries, even the masters of the order and the Archbishops of Prague, and at that time, the Order of the Knights of the Cross repaired
the Church of St. Francis in the form you see today. The construction plans were drafted by Frenchman Jean Baptiste Mathey around 1679. The dominant feature of the church is a massive, forty meter high, brick dome. Along the sides of the entrance you can see the statues of the Madonna and St. Jan Nepomuk; on the facade there are statues of Czech patrons. In the interior the church has a cross on the ground plan and is oriented by the main altar to the north, which is unusual. On the ceiling you will find a fresco of the Last Judgment by Václav Vavřinec Reiner. The church was renowned for its excellent music, and the local masses were among the biggest musical events of Prague. You can also see one of the most beautiful organs in Prague, played by a young Antonin Dvořák. Vine Column / Viniční sloup. Just close to the corner of the church you can see the statues of St. Wenceslas on a stone, grapevine-wrapped
column. This is so-called Vine Column that indicated the place for collecting tax on the common grape vine the opposite building. Around the column you can see the oldest Prague paving from the 12th century. 

Statue of the King Charles IV / Socha Karla IV. The bronze statue of the King and Emperor Charles IV also stands on the square. It was built here in 1848 to
mark the 500th anniversary of the founding of Charles University. King and Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378) was the most important Czech king and one of the most powerful sovereigns of medieval Europe. In 1355 he became the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He was educated, and after his father, John of Luxembourg, one of the greatest European knights, inheriting a warlike nature. He spoke five languages​​ fluently and used his power to consolidate the Czech state, which has since been known as the Crown of the Czech Lands. He was also the author of the most important imperial constitutional law of the Golden Bull of Charles, which was valid until the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Prague was chosen as the capital city of the empire and it grew under its rule. The traces of its builder’s effort are all over the city. He founded the University, built churches, bridges over the Vltava, the cathedral, built Prague Castle and the entire New Town of Prague. The Czechs today call him the Father of the Homeland to this day.

## Clementinum(Klementinum)

The Clementinum, a former Jesuit college, is the second largest place of interest in Prague after Prague Castle, and the largest Jesuit building in the Czech lands. The Jesuits arrived in Prague in 1556 on the invitation of Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I in order to strengthen the Counter- Reformation in the Czech lands. For more than 200 years they built up their college, a complex of buildings between four streets and two squares and divided by five courtyards. Architects such as Carlo Lugaro, Francesco Caratti, Domenico Orsi and František Maxmilian Kaňka worked on the Clementinum. The statues adorning the buildings are the work of Jan Jiři Bendl – the statues of the saints on the fasade of the Church of the Holy Saviour are by Giovanni Bartolomeo Cometi. Other interesting features at the Clementinum are the thirteen sundials on the walls of the various buildings and the tower of the ob-servatory from 1751, from which the noon gun used to be fired. During their time in the Czech lands and at the Klementinum, the Jesuits devoted much of their effort to education. They built all kinds of schools and in 1571 they were granted permission by the pope to award academic titles. Many future Czech scholars, who would have a significant bearing on the history of the country, studied at schools and colleges in the Klementinum. The Jesuit Order also had its darker side such as witch trials and book burning. In 1773 the Jesuit Order was abolished by Pope Clement XIV and the monks were forced to leave the Klementinum. In the third courtyard of the complex rises the observatory tower with the metal statue of Atlantis on the top. For more than 200 years (since 1775) a meteorological observatory has been in constant operation here, recording the weather in Prague, longer than anywhere else in Europe. The entrance to the Mirrored Chapel, now used as a concert hall, can be found in the fourth courtyard. Most of its halls are decorated with rich stucco work or paintings. At present, the Clementinum is home to the National Library and many valuable collections of books can be found here.

## Prague Castle

### Lobkowicz Palace

Get the tickets for Prague Castle from Lobkowicz Palace for 50 CZK discount. Lobkowicz Palace and Prague Castle entrance tickets bundle ticket.

The palace was built in the second half of the 16th century by the Czech nobleman Jaroslav of Pernštejn (1528–1569) and completed by his brother, Vratislav of Pernštejn (1530–1582), the chancellor of the Czech Kingdom. It was opened to the public for the first time on 2 April 2007 as the Lobkowicz Palace Museum. Set in 22 galleries, the museum displays a selection of pieces from the Lobkowicz Collections, including works by artists such as Antonio Canaletto, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Diego Velázquez, as well as decorative art, military and hunting paraphernalia, musical instruments, and original manuscripts and early prints of composers including Beethoven and Mozart.

### Old Royal Palace

The original residence building, mostly wooden, was built at Prague Castle already at the turn of the 9th and 10th century. Its exact location is not documented. It was prince Soběslav in the 12th century who had a stone Romanesque palace built right next to a new fortification wall. Remains of it have been preserved in the underground till the present times. The palace was adjoined on its eastern side by All Saints' Chapel, which was consecrated in 1185.

In the first half of the 14th century, the king and emperor Charles IV enlarged the Romanesque building and so a Gothic palace with a vaulted interior for state purposes and a band of arcades on its northern side came to be. During the reign of his son Wenceslas IV, two perpendicular wings were added and All Saints' Chapel was reconstructed.

The palace was deserted for entire eighty years of the stormy 15th century. After 1483, the king Vladislav Jagiello returned to Prague Castle and commenced the last large-scale reconstruction of the palace. The magnificent solemn Vladislav Hall was added to it and when designing it, the architect Benedikt Ried combined the art of the Late Gothic with elements of the newly arriving Renaissance style. The perpendicular palace wing named after Vladislav's son Ludvig is also the work of B. Ried. After the succession of the Habsburgs to the Bohemian throne, the interiors of the Old Royal Palace were used for coronation festivities and diets and as conference rooms, offices and depositories. New dwelling quarters were built to the west of the palace, in the southern part of the Castle complex. After the catastrophic fire which occurred in 1541, the Diet and All Saints' Church were rebuilt.

From the 16th century, the Vladislav Hall served particularly royal state purposes. It was the scene of coronation festivities and banquets, knights' tournaments and markets with artistic and luxurious goods. The Vladislav Hall still partly fulfils the state function: the elections of the president of the Czech Republic used to take place there and ceremonial gatherings connected with important days in the life of this country are held there still.

Neighbouring on the Vladislav Hall is the Diet, which through the furnishings of its interior affords an idea of the way in which the proceedings of the Diet took place after 1627, and also All Saints' Church. From the south-western corner of the Vladislav Hall a portal leads to the Ludwig Wing with the offices of the Czech Chancellery. In 1618, its second room witnessed the beginning of the uprising of the Czech Estates when two governors and a scribe were thrown into the Castle ditch from its window. The uprising of the Czech Estates was the first conflict of the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648).

The observation gallery on the southern wall of the Vladislav Hall affords a beautiful view of the Garden on the Ramparts and of Prague.

Nowadays, the exit from the Vladislav Hall is formed by the Riders' Staircase, built originally to enable knights to enter the hall on horseback in order to take part in the jousting competitions held in it. The staircase is vaulted with a complicated Late Gothic rib vault.

All Saints' Church
The All Saints' Church was built by Petr Parler on the site of the Romanesque palace chapel, also consecrated to All Saints. According to old sources, the church was magnificently decorated in the manner of Sainte Chapelle in Paris. However, after the great fire of 1541, only its peripheral walls remained.

In the course of its renewal, the church was extended as far as the facade of the Vladislav Hall and during later modifications it was connected with it by means of a portal.

### St. George's Basilica

St. George's Basilica originated as the second church at Prague Castle. Only parts of the building, founded about 920 by Prince Vratislav I have been preserved. When the convent of Benedictine nuns was founded in 973, the church was enlarged and reconstructed.

The present Romanesque appearance of the church with main apse and two steeples dates back to the time of the reconstruction carried out after the devastating fire which occurred in 1142. In the first half of the 13th century, a chapel consecrated to St. Ludmila was added to the church as well as a portico on its western side. The Early Baroque period left its mark in the form of the present striking facade and the reconstruction of the whole convent. In the early 18th century, the architect F.M. Kanka added the Baroque Chapel of St. John Nepomuk to the church. After the devastating occupation of the convent by troops in the late 18th century, the church was renewed in the years 1887 to 1908 after the design by F. Mach, who tried to restore its Romanesque appearance. In the period from 1969 to 1975 the convent was also reconstructed and adapted for the installation of the exposition of old Bohemian art of the National Gallery. Now, the Convent is used for short-term exhibitions.

The interior of the basilica is Romanesque, austere and monumental. The tombs of members of the ruling Premyslid dynasty are situated in the main nave. One of them belongs to prince Vratislav, father of St. Wenceslas.

### The Golden Lane 

The Golden Lane originated after the construction of a new northern wall of the Castle. The area of the northern bailey was used for the building of modest dwellings, which are now the last remainder of the small-scale architecture of Prague Castle.

They were inhabited by defenders of the Castle, servants or for example goldsmiths and the Castle marksmen. The tiny houses were occupied until World War II, but already during the period of the First Republic, care was taken to ensure that the picturesque character of the Lane was not changed in the course of modifications. From 1916 to 1917 house No. 22 was inhabited by the writer Franz Kafka.

The appearance of a 16th-century dwelling is best demonstrated by house No. 13, which is a Renaissance home of a member of the guard, so called "Red Musket". In the neighbouring house, No. 14, there lived before World War II a famous fortune-teller "Madame de Thebes", whose clientele was both local and from overseas as is documented in her correspondence. Because of her predictions of a near fall of the Third Reich, she was arrested by the German secret police and died during an interrogation.

The name of the Lane is derived from goldsmiths who used to live there, as can be seen in the house No. 15. In the 16th century, the name "Goldsmith Lane" has been documented which later changed to the present "Golden Lane".

The staircase in house No. 12 affords access to the terrace in front of the tower called Daliborka. This round cannon tower formed a part of the Jagiello fortification system and its bottom floor was used as a prison. The first and also the best-known prisoner was the knight Dalibor of Kozojedy, who was imprisoned here in 1498.

A sister of writer Franz Kafka rented the house number 22 in the summer of 1916; Kafka used this house to write for approximately one year.

### Daliborka Tower

At the eastern end of the Golden Lane stands a round tower, shrouded in legend. Dating back to 1496, the tower, which served as a prison until 1781, is named after its first inmate – Dalibor of Kozojedy. According to a legend, Dalibor learned to play violin in the prison and with his music earned not only money but also sympathies​ of local people.

In addition to the dungeon with its monumental vaults, there is a circular opening in the floor through which offenders were lowered into the oubliette with the help of a pulley. The Daliborka Tower is part of the Prague Castle guided tour.

### St. Vitus Cathedral

St. Vitus Cathedral is the largest and the most important temple in Prague. Apart from religious services, coronations of Czech kings and queens also took place here. The cathedral is a place of burial of several patron saints, sovereigns, noblemen and archbishops.

The cathedral is the third church consecrated to the same saint on the same site. Around the year 925, Prince Wenceslas (Václav) founded a Romanesque rotunda here, which after 1060 was converted into a basilica with three naves and two steeples. The importance of the church grew especially after the establishment of the Prague bishopric in 973 and the founding of the body of canons - the St. Vitus chapter, which later became an important cultural and administrative institution.

In 1344, Charles IV began the construction of a Gothic cathedral. Its first builders, Matthias of Arras and later Peter Parler, built the chancel with a ring of chapels, St. Wenceslas Chapel, the Golden Gate and the lower part of the Great South Tower. It was already Peter Parler who started the construction of the South Tower, however he did not complete it. In the 16th century, is was finished with a Renaissance view gallery and a helmet. Later in the 18th century, the older helmet was replaced by a new dome.

Unfortunately, in 1419 the construction of the Cathedral stopped because of the Hussite Wars. In spite of the endeavours of some sovereigns to secure the continuation of the construction work, the Cathedral remained uncompleted for whole centuries. The facade of the Cathedral was provisionally closed and for example the music choir was bulit.

It was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the Union for the Completion of the Cathedral began the repair of the original part and the completion of the Cathedral in Neo-Gothic style. The church was solemnly consecrated in 1929. Its interior was subjected to adaptations even in later years.

Visitors enter the Cathedral through the portal in the western facade, opposite the passage-way between the Second and Third Courtyard of Prague Castle.

Its bronze door is decorated with reliefs with scenes from the history of the Cathedral and from the legends about St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert.

The Neo-Gothic part of the Cathedral consists of the main nave and the narrow side aisles, lined with chapels, and the northern wing of the transverse nave. The chapels have stained glass windows. In the cross nave, the ceremonial entrance into the Cathedral can be seen - the Golden Gate - leading to the Third Courtyard.

Situated in the chancel of the Cathedral, in front of the high altar, is the Royal Mausoleum below which there is the royal crypt. The chancel is surrounded by a ring of Gothic chapels. Czech sovereigns and patron saints are interred in some of them.

St. Wenceslas Chapel is a cult centre of St. Vitus Cathedral. Its magnificent decoration and the different conception of its architecture emphasize its singularity as the central point of the Cathedral with the tomb of the most important Czech patron saint. The facing of the walls, consisting of precious stones, and the wall paintings of the Passion Cycle are parts of the original 14th-century decoration of the chapel. The scenes from the life of St. Wenceslas forming another decorative band are attributed to the workshop of the Master of the Litomerice Altar (the cycle dates back to 1509).

The door in the south-western corner of the chapel leads to the Crown Chamber in which the Bohemian Coronation Jewels are kept.

c) Habsburgs  

### Royal Garden

The originally Renaissance garden founded in 1534 became one of the few quiet places in the centre of Prague. The garden is located on the site of old medieval vineyards.

Royal Garden was commissioned by the Habsburg Ferdinand I. From the owners he gradually bought old vineyards beyond the valley of the Brusnice stream and had a Renaissance garden laid out here, which later became famous for its rare botanical specimens and the exotic plants gained from distant countries. From the very beginning, there were situated a number of buildings serving the entertainment of the nobility: the Ball Game Hall, the Royal Summer Palace, the Lion Court. Currently the garden follows the tradition of an "English-style" park created there in the mid 19th century, but it also contains elements of Renaissance character (giardinetto near the Royal Summer Palace) as well as Baroque elements (ornamental flower beds). It can be approached via three entrances: two western gates from the street U Prašného mostu and the northern gate near the Royal Summer Palace.

### The South Gardens

The South Gardens were established gradually on the location of bulwarks beneath Prague Castle. The last renovation in 2012 restored their original appearance from 1920's when they were renovated by the Slovenian architekt Josip Plečnik for the first Czechoslovak president T. G. Masaryk.

The South Gardens are nearly 500 metres long and in the summer tourist season it is possible to enter them from Opyš near the eastern gate or via the Bull Staircase from the Third Courtyard. The west gate between Hradčany Square (Hradčanské náměstí) and the South Gardens is for exit only. The South Gardens are comprised of three smaller gardens.

Paradise Garden
The garden is situated on the spot of the oldest garden in front of the southern wall of the Castle, where a private garden of Archduke Ferdinand used to be in the fifties of the 16th century. Similarly, the emperor Rudolf II also had his private garden here with a bath or for example an aviary. Architect Plečnik designed its current image in 1920's. A monumetal straircase and a big granite bowl became its dominants. On one site the stone border even changes course to bypass probably one of the oldest trees at Prague Castle - a yew tree with the estimated age of about 400 years.

Garden on the Ramparts
The name of the garden refers to an old rampart on the southern side of the Castle where later small gardens were founded to be turned into a natural park in the 19th century. In 1849, a fortification wall was built around the area and can still be seen there, although it has been lowered in 1920's during the renovations of Josip Plečnik. The garden has a unified geometric appearance and it runs beneath most of the southern face wall of Prague Castle. Its central terrace offers a breathtaking view of Prague. At the end of the gardens there is the so called Moravian Bastion, a secluded place where T. G. Masaryk liked to sit.

Hartig Garden
The Hartig Garden with a Music Pavilion is the smallest of the gardens on the southern side of the Castle and it was connected to them in 1960's. Its current image hails back to 1965 to the design by architects Adolf Bens and Richard Podzemny. The garden is closed for public.

### Stag Moat

The Stag Moat a natural ravine of the Brusnice stream. It got its name because of breeding of deer here in the 17th century.
It was possible to see deer in the Moat till the 18th century. This tradition was symbolically followed in the 20th century, when a bear pen was founded there. Between 2001 and 2007, a tunnel after the design of architect J. Pleskot was bulit through the embankment between the Upper and the Lower Moat. The Stag Moat is open to public in the summer season.

## The Lesser Town / Malá Strana

The Lesser Town was the second part of Prague to be established after the Old Town. It was created by King Přemysl Otakar II in 1257, mainly to beef up the defences surrounding the castle. The first inhabitants of the Lesser Town were settlers from northern Germany. The area underwent extensive development during the reign of Charles IV. He enlarged it considerably and put up defensive walls, a part of which is called the Hungerall, which can still be seen today at the top of Petřín Hill.

From the outset there were a large number of religious sites in the small area the Lesser Town occupies. This concentration of churches led at the beginning of the Hussite wars in 1419 to the complete plunder of the LesserTown. The Hussites attacked the royal barracks and burnt down the Archbishop’s court and half the district went with it. The Lesser Town had only just recovered when another disaster struck. In 1541 a huge fire broke out on this side of the river, practically razing the area to the ground. It was only after this did the Lesser Town acquire its current appearance which differs so much from the Old Town. Around the castle huge resi-dences were constructed and the nobility built luxury palaces. These buildings were mainly baroque in style. In the 17th century, residences such as the Valdštejn, Nostitz, Michnovsky and Furstenberg Palaces were built. Architects such as Kilian Ignac Dienzenho-
fer, Anselmo Lurago, Giovanni Domenico Orsi and many other famous names worked there. The beauty of the Mala Strana was heightened by the creation of numerous gardens and terraced slo-
pes, an architectural speciality of central Europe.

### Wallenstein Palace / Valdštejn Palac

The Wallenstein Palace, a long block standing opposite the Ledeburg Palace, was one of the first baroque buildings to appear in Prague. It was built by Duke Albrecht von Wallenstein, Emperor Ferdinand II’s generalissimo, as his private residence. Albrecht von Wallenstein became a legendary figure during the Thirty Year’s War. During the struggle between the Czech Estates and the Habsburg monarchy, he cleverly sided with the king, confiscating property of the defeated Czech nobility for himself. Wallenstein was a slippery character who, in the course of the war, managed to change sides several times, but always with an eye on gaining property. When he actually began to consider taking the imperial crown away from the Habsburgs, the emperor had him murdered in Cheb in 1634, to the relief of many.

The Valdštejn Palace was intended to compete with the royal palace in grandness and size. The Italian architects Spezza, Marini, Pieronni and Sebregondi all worked on this monumental baroque structure. The main, 60m long fasade is fairly simple and is more Renaissance in character, but the arrival of the new baroque style can be seen on the three entranceways, of which the middle one is false. Inside, the highlight of the palace is the remarkable Main Hall which is two storeys high. It is decorated with stucco work and ceiling frescoes by Italian Baccio Bianco depicting Wallenstein himself as the god Mars. The Chapel of St Wenceslas boasts the oldest baroque altar in Prague dating from 1630. Adjoining the main building of the palace is the sala terrena, in front of which extends the Valdštejn Garden, a baroque Frenchstyle park. The sala terrena is a huge hall, full of columns and decorated with stucco and paintings depicting scenes from the Trojan Wars (1629 – 30), again by Baccio Bianco. To the right is a manmade dripstone cave. From the sala terrena one can see the Venus Fountain and a row of bronze statues by Adrian de Vries, regarded as the best example of Mannierism in Europe. Sadly, they are copies as the originals were carted off by Swedish troops in 1648. In the rear section of the garden visitors will find a pool full of fish, in the centre of which stands de Vries’s Hercules. Beyond the pool stands the old riding school, now used by the National Gallery for temporary exhibitions.

The builing now houses the Senate of the Czech Republic and the gardens with free entrace are considered the most beautiful in Prague. Enter the gardens through the small door from Letenska street.

### Palace Gardens under Prague Castle

These gardens are located in places where in the Middle Ages one would have found vineyards growing on the steep northern approaches to Prague Castle. In the 16th century, the nobility began to construct palaces and terraced gardens here. It deals with almost the whole area under Prague Castle between Wallenstein Square and Klárov. All the palace terrace gardens have rich architectural decorations, decorative staircases, balustrades, lookout terraces, gloriettes and pavilions combined with vegetation into picturesque wholes. It is a magnificent view of Prague. Go along the stairs to Prague Castle, and you can relax. The three gardens, which once belonged to the Ledeburg, Furstenberg and Palffy palaces, were joined together to form a single garden. The Fūrstenberg Garden was created in 1784 by Ignac Palliardi. On the upper terrace there is a pavilion, decorated with statues and classic vases. The small house with the bulbous tower high up on the hill once housed a spa for the owner, Barbora Černinova. The Palffy Garden isn’t as richly adorned, but one can still find a unique sundial painted at the top of the covered staircase. The Ledeburg Garden boasts a stunning sala terrena by architects Jan Santini and Giovanni Battista Alliprandi. The gardens are accessed from the Palffy Palace in Valdštejnske Square and are well worth a visit.

### St. Thomas Church

The impulse to found the St. Thomas Church was given by the Czech King Wenceslas II. This pious monarch was thus the initiator of the founding of the gorgeous Gothic church in the middle of the Lesser Town. Already from the distance you can see the high church tower, one of the dominating features of the church. St. Thomas Church allong with St. Nicholas Church belong to significant Baroque monuments of the Lesser Town. The originally Gothic church of St. Thomas was built on the foundations of an old Romanic church. The church was consecrated in 1379. It had to face the uneasy fate in the Hussite period when the local monks were chased out and the church burnt down. The church was reconstructed thank to the Augustinian Hermits allong with the architect Bernard die Alberto btw.

1584-1592. Another fire affected it in the 16th century and this time also the church gallery collapsed. The Renaissance reconstruction was completed at the end of the 17th century. The Order of the Augustinians called for the new reconstruction the architect Kilián Ignác Dientzenhofer whose designs are responsible for the current Baroque appearance.
Do not forget to look at the main altar during your seightseeing of the church interior. Here you can see the painting The Martyrdom of St. Thomas by Peter Paul Rubens. But it is just a replica of the painting if you want to see the original you need to visit the National Gallery of Prague. If you visit the former capitular hall,.i.e. the current Chapel
of St. Dorothy you can adore the paintings by Josef Heintz there. The lovers of the art visiting the church will certainly be satisfied – another treasures are the paintings by Karel Škréta. The crypt which is located in the internals of the church belongs to its chief curiosities and makes the place so much popular with the tourists. Many significant people found their place of the last piece here. Among the most noted ones belongs e.g. Adrian de Vries. We know his name from the walks through the Valdštejn Garden because he was the author of
the sculptural decorations. In case you find it his grave it is located in St. Barbara´s Chapel. The Valdštejn Garden is situated right beside the church where you can see the works of this great sculptor. Another significant person is the architect Ulrik Aostalli alias Aegidius Sadeler. This noted engraver and graphic designer was active also at the court of Rudolph II. He was the master of the chiaroscuro art and also published the map of Bohemia at the beginning of the 17th century.

### Lesser town square

See the picture map of the square.

A square has been located in this part of Prague since the foundation of the Lesser Town District in the 13th century. It was originally a marketplace, divided into two parts by  buildings in the middle. Most of the houses on the square have Gothic foundations with Renaissance and baroque upper floors and facades. But most of them disappeared after the devastating
fire of 1541 and were replaced by noble residences. The dominant feature of today’s square is the most beautiful Baroque church in Prague: St. Nicholas Cathedral. We describe it for you in another article. We will now focus on the surrounding buildings and palaces. And we will go clockwise. 

Lesser Town Hall / Malostranská radnice. On the corner of Letenská Street and the Lesser Town Square stands the Lesser Town Hall from 1478. Here, decisions were made on city administration, criminal and civil cases. The building is known for the year 1575, when the so-called Czech Confession was written here. It was a memorandum of understanding allowing religious freedom in Czechia. Something completely unique in this time in Europe. The commemorative plaque of this event is located in the town hall. 

Kaiserstein Palace / Kaiserštejnský palác is a bit further on the corner with Mostecká Street. The most famous Czech opera singer Ema Destinová lived In this palace several years before World War I, who became especially famous abroad. She was the prima dona at the Berlin Opera, engaged in the Metropolitan Opera in New York, singing alongside Enrico Caruso. Today,
you can also find her memorial plaque.

### St. Nicholas Cathedral / Chrám sv. Mikuláše. 

If you would like to see Prague through the eyes of secret service agents, you have a unique opportunity. All you have to do is to climb the tower of St. Nicholas Cathedral. 215 stairs, up to 65 meters. Originally a tower in which an announcer lived, whose task was to ring it during a fire. In the 1950’s during the era of socialism, there was a secret State Security observatory, which monitored movements from nearby Western embassies. Today this observatory is made available to the public along with its equipment.

The Church of St Nicholas dominates Malostranske Square. The church is one of the most exquisite baroque buildings anywhere in Europe and is built on the grand principle of interlocking ellipsoids. Building work was begun on the church in 1703 on the site of an earlier Gothic church dedicated to the same saint. The order behind the building of a new place of worship was the Jesuits, who acquired the site through one of the most influential men in the country, Albrecht von Wallenstein. It was such an important building project that Emperor Leopold I.
himself came to lay the first stone. In the first phase of construction Kryštof Dientzenhofer demonstrated his remarkable skills as a builder. He is responsible for the nave and the side
chapels. The dynamic 40 m high twisting facade and huge interior were the first architectural experiment of its kind on a baroque building in Europe. 
Kryštof’s son Kilian Ignac Dienzenhofer, who took over the project when his father died, built the presbytery with its huge dome. After him, Anselmo Lurago added the slender spire in 1751-56. One enters the church via an entrance, above which the Kolowrat coat of arms tells allcomers that they were significant benefactors when the church was being built.

The vast ceiling fresco in the nave called The Glory of St Nicholas is by Jan Lukaš Kracker, and whit 1500m2 it one of the largest in Europe. It said about the fresco that he the painter was working on it, he didn’t want anybody watching him. He only wanted the work to be seen when it was finished. But one of the Jesuit monks was so curious that would hide behind one of the church pillars to watch. However, the painter caught sight of him, and as a punishment he included him in the fresco as a figure hiding behind a pillar watching everything. When the painter was finished and everyone was let in to admire the work, they couldn’t stop laughing when they recognised their colleague on the ceiling! The fresco in the dome is the work of František Xaver Palko and depicts the Glory of the Holy Trinity. Palko was the most celebrated artist of his time with the possible exception of V. V. Reiner. The dome is 70m high and  the spire next to it reaches 79m into the Prague skyline. The nave is adorned with numerous late baroque sculptures, mainly by Ignac František Platzer. Probably the most noteworthy works of art in the entire church are paintings by Karel Škreta–The Crucifixion from the mid 17th century in the Chapel of St Barbora and the Passion Cycle in the church gallery. In 1773, after the abolition of the Jesuit Order, the Church of St Nicholas became the main parish church of the Mala Strana.


Liechtenstein Palace / Lichtejnštejsnký palác. Most of the western side of the square, across from the entrance to the St. Nicholas Cathedral is occupied by Liechtenstein Palace. In the years 1622-23, its owner was Prince Charles of Liechtenstein, nicknamed the “bloody vice regent”. He was the author and executor of punishing the leaders of the estate uprising after
the Battle of White Mountain, which we mentioned several times. He was very ruthless. In vain, the members of the convicted walked to the palace asking for mercy. They all ended up on the executioner’s scaffolding in the Old Town Square. Here you can also see a reminder of those 27 executed in the form of 27 stylized cast iron heads on the cornerstones at the curb in front of the palace. In 1848 there was the main military tent of General Windischgrätz and from there he repressed rebel insurgents throughout Austria - Hungary.

### Nerudova Street / Nerudova ulice. 

This steep, picturesque street is the main road linking the Mala Strana and Hradčany. It was once part of the Royal Way, the route sovereigns would follow up to Prague Castle on the day of their coronation. The street has a distinctly baroque appearance, but many of the houses date back to medieval times. The street, originally called Strahovska at the lower end and Ostruhova at the top end, was renamed at the end of the 19th century after the writer and journalist Jan Neruda who spent a part of his life in the street, and who wrote about the Mala Strana in many of his books. This street is well known for its house symbols. House symbols were an everyday sight until Austrian Empress Maria  Theresa had the houses numbered. They made the houses distinguishable from those around them and often told a great deal about the status, occupation or name of the owner. 

Morzin Palace / Morzinský palác. (No. 5) 
This baroque palace on the lefthand side of Nerudova Street replaced four old houses and was given its current appearance by Giovanni Santini in 1713-14. The fasade was decorated by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff with statues of Moors, allegorical busts representing Day and Night and statues representing the four continents known to antiquity (Europe, Asia, America and Africa). The Morzinsky Palace now houses the Romanian Embassy.a plaque of Mihai Viteazu.

House U TŘÍ HOUSLIČEK (No. 12) (House of the Three Little Violins). Just the name tells us that three families of Prague violin makers lived here, one after the other. The house facade is decorated with paintings of Greek gods. Another interesting dwelling is the Renaissance House U ZLATÉ ČÍŠE (No.16) (House of the olden Chalice). As the name suggests, it was owned
by a goldsmith. 

The House U ST. JANA NEPOMUCKÉHO (No.18) (House of St John of Nepomuk), originally a Renaissance building, was given a baroque face in the early 18th century. The entrance is decorated with a relief of St John of Nepomuk from the beginning of the 18th century. 

Thun - Hohenstein Place / Palác Thun – Hohensteinský (No. 20). Now the Italian Embassy, this palace was built in 1721-26 by Giovanni Santini, originally for the Kolowrat family. Matthias Bernard Braun placed two gigantic eagles beside the entrance, symbols of the Kolowrat family. Above the entrance he put statues representing Jupiter and Junona. The staircase inside the palace was rebuilt in 1871 by Josef Zitek. It is lined with paintings of various stages of human life from the cradle to the grave by Josef Tulka and František Ženišek (who designed the curtain at the National Theatre)

Midway up the street, notice the green house that protrudes from the row and makes the street quite narrow. This house was originally joined onto the Strahov Gate. In the Middle Ages, the Mala Strana town walls ran through the street at this point. The house is now a tea room. Legend has it that every Friday night a firey team of horses thunders through this place, on which sits a headless skeleton waiting for his soul to be released from damnation, but nobody knows how to set him free. Approximately midway up Nerudova Street stands the monastery and the CHURCH OF OUR LADY OF UNCEASING SUCCOUR dating from the 18th cen tury and probably built by architects Jean B. Mathey and Jan Blažej Santini. The church is decorated with statues by Matěj Vaclav Jaeckl. 

One of the last houses at the top of Nerudova Street is the HOUSE U DVOU SLUNCŮ (No. 47) (House of the Two Suns), where the writer Jan Neruda lived from 1845-57. The last house at the top of the hill is called U ZLATÉ HVĚZDY (House of the Golden Star). Here the streets veers to the right and becomes KE HRADU Street. This street was driven through rock in 1638-44, in order to give better access to the castle. Immediately above Ke Hradu
Street towers the Renaissance Schwarzenberg Palace in Hradčanske Square

### The Vrtba Garden / Vrtbovská zahrada 

This garden is said to be the most beautiful palace baroque garden north of the Alps. And definitely worthseeing. The entrance to it is inconspicuous, through the passage of house no. 25, on the left side of Karmelitská Street, just behind the junction with Tržiště Street. František Maxmilián Kaňka deserves credit for the appearance of this garden, since he was employed in the years 1715 - 1720 by Count Jan Josef Vrtba, who held the office of the highest burgrave Prague Castle. Kaňka deserved credit not only the rebuilding of the palace in  which the Count resided, but also the creation of the unique baroque garden that surrounded it. With the help of the perfect sculptural art of Matyáš Bernard Braun and thanks to the frescoes of Václav Vavřinec Reiner, a beautiful area was created, which until now has been considered one of the most attractive gardens of its kind.

In the garden, reaching a maximum of two hundred and twelve meters and an area of ​​0.31 hectares, you can see the unique shrubs and trees that comprise the magnificent appearance of the garden besides the beautiful ancient statues and frescoes. The Vrtba Garden is comprised of terraces with three levels of height, each of which has a unique view ahead before you. These terraces are connected by wide stairways and intertwine. This allows you a bird’s eye view, for example of Prague Castle, St. Nicholas Cathedral or the further Tyn Cathedral. During the walk do not miss the unique decoration of the terrace hall (garden hall), which depicts Venus and Adonis by Václav Vavřinec Reiner. The terrace hall forms a kind of connection between the adjacent palace and the garden. Other attractions worth seeing are the swimming pool in the lower part of the garden where the putti (baby) statuette is placed on the sea monster
and the aviary built into the palace wall.

### Church of Our Lady Victorious and The Infant Jesus of Prague / Kostel Panny Marie Vítězné a Pražské Jezulátko

The Lesser Town Church of Our Lady of Victory is probably the most famous Prague Church in the world. There is the famous statue of the Infant Jesus of Prague, known in Catholic countries as the Bambino di Praga. The statue arrived to Prague from Spain in the 16th century as the property of the court lady Marie Manriquez de Lara, a noblewoman from one of the
most important Spanish families and the wife of the Supreme Chancellor of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Vratislav of Pernštejn. The statuette, according to the Spanish family tradition, passed from mother to daughter as a protector of the family fireplace. Mary’s daughter, known as Polyxena of Lobkovic, had only one son, and so like a faithful Catholic, he donated this rare wax
statue to the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites at the Church of Our Lady of Victory. Since then, many miracles have been associated with the statue.

The order of the Discalced Carmelites was very hard. Its members lived only from alms, and very often they had nothing to eat. At a time when they suffered from the most squalor and poverty, they received a small statue of the Infant Jesus from Polyxena of Lobkovic, saying that she was giving them the most valuable thing she had and, if they would honor the statue, would no longer suffer from penury. The monks regularly prayed to the Infant Jesus. And their lives began to change. Soon the Emperor ordered for the monastery to receive money and food. Even the monastery vineyards began to be fertile. The statue miraculously helped during the plague epidemics, rescuing the monastery against pillaging several times. During the 30’s
however, it was lost for several years. It was at the time when he Carmelites were transferred to Germany, and nobody cared about the Infant Jesus. After their return in 1638, the church was devastated and destroyed. The Infant Jesus sculpture was discovered behind an altar with damaged hands, but otherwise in a surprisingly good condition. It was repaired and the monastery began to flourish again. The Infant Jesus began to be carried in the processions and in 1655 was officially crowned by the Prague bishop as miraculous. This reputation has spread throughout the world. To date, thousands of people travel to the church, asking the Infant Jesus for help, healing, the birth of a child. Others return to thank the statue for fulfilling their plea. The statue is the most worshiped in Spain, Italy and Latin America. 400 years ago a copy of the statue of the Infant Jesus of Prague even helped unify the Philippines. Thanks to it the missionaries reconciled fighting parties. The Church of Our Lady of Victory was built between 1611 and 1612 by German Lutherans and was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. During the re-Catholization after 1621 the Lutherans from the church were banished and the church was donated by Emperor Ferdinand II as a reward for the order of the Decalced Carmelites who helped the Emperor’s army in the Battle of the White Mountain. The Carmelites rebuilt the church, changed its disposition, dedicated it to the Virgin Mary of Victory and built a monastery here.

All this to distinguish themselves from the Protestants. Most of the works that decorate the interior of the church arose in the 17th and 18th centuries. Besides the Infant Jesus of Prague, the most important works are paintings by Petr Brandl. The Prophet Elijah can be found in the chancel, St. John the Baptist. Joseph, Simon, Jachym and Anna on the side altars. The
statues here are from Jan Jiří Bendl. The main altar is characterized by its alternation of gold and black. An interesting part of the church is also its crypt. Over 200 people were buried here between 1666 and 1716. Mostly Carmelites and their supporters. The crypt was damaged several times in the past by water and is unfortunately now inaccessible. But you can see
the Infant Jesus at any time. In these places you can also find yourself under Petřín Hill, which offers beautiful views of Prague Castle and all Prague. On top of the hil, you can climb to the Petřín lookout tower, which is a 5x smaller replica of the Paris Eiffel Tower. If you want to look at it, go straight through Karmelitska Street to the right of the cable car. It safely and quickly transports you to Petřín. The way from here cannot be easier.

### Virgin Mary under Chain / Kostel Panny Marie pod řetězem

The Church of the Virgin Mary Under Chain was founded between 1158 and 1169 by the second Czech King Vladislav II, after his return from the second crusade preparing and donated it to the knightly order of the Johannites (nowadays the Knights of Malta) along with other lands along the river. The church is a part of the huge order of the complex in Prague and was
literally a fortress in the Middle Ages. Even today, the pair of Romanesque towers and the entire facade resemble the original fighting aspect of the Order. The Johanites were a very strong Christian knighthood in the Middle Ages. They were founded in Jerusalem with the task of accompanying pilgrims to the grave of God, but they soon formed the core of the Christian
army and participated in a series of battles against Muslims. Only the Order of the Templars and the Order of the German Knights could equal their strength. The Order of the Johanites was later renamed the Knights of Malta, and still functions mainly as a hospital. In Prague it is one of the six grand large priories and enjoys special prestige, because it is one of the
oldest and with constant continuity. 

The Church of Our Lady itself Under Chain has Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. It was rebuilt several times and burned several times. To this day the building boasts two 32-meter-high prismatic towers that support the massive corner pillars. The other things you see are large part of the work of early Baroque builder Carl Lurago. Interesting is the
name of the church - Under Chain. Allegedly every night there stretched a chain from this location across the Vltava River to the Old Town to prevent the passage of ships that did not pay the toll and the gate of the commandry was also closed. Inside the church you can see the gems of Bohemian Baroque painting. On the main altar there is the Battle of Lepanto and
a Johanite praying to the Virgin Mary. At Lepanto, the Johanites led their last big battle and overcame the Ottoman Empire. The Order was conferred knighthood in front of the painting. The artist is Karel Škréta. From him also comes the picture of St. Barbora on the side altar. Historically it is also interesting that here in 1378 the body of the late Emperor Charles IV was exhibited and in the time of the reign of his son Wenceslas IV there was the arrest at the peace meeting with the King of St. Jan Nepomuk, then general vicar of the Archbishop of Prague. He died as a result of torture, and the same day his dead body was thrown from Charles Bridge into the Vltava River.

## Vysehrad Castle (Vyšehrad)

Vyšehrad is a place full of secrets. Still, it raises many questions for us. Be informed, when in fact the castle was built. Its past, shrouded by veils of mystery, offers writers and
ordinary people several important myths and legends. From Jirasek's work are known the legends about Princess Libuse, who ruled the Czech lands from Vysehrad, and later married Přemysl the Ploughman, the father all the Přemysl family. 

Another story, which highlights the power of the Czechs, tells of the brave Bivoj, who overcame a horrible boar terrorizing the neighborhood with his bare hands. But when the site was first inhabited by the royal family, we do not know yet. There are some legends that already by the second half of the 10th century the king Boleslav II lived there. Coins discovered during his reing are the first to bare the inscription of the castle Wisegradus. One thing is for sure: Vyšehrad acquired considerable fame under Vratislav II. If someone was going from the south towards Prague, they would have to ride around Vyšehrad. They would be greeted from afar by the two tall black towers of Peter and Paul, St. Steven's Basilica, and the heavy set walls. Vyšehrad really had a very good strategic position, because it is effectively protected from conquerors. Leading to the castle are only two access roads through gates over a ditch. The other parts of the castle are protected by a huge cliff and the river Vltava. At the other end of the castle, away from the gate and over the cliff sloping towards the river, long ago there once was a royal palace. Today, we find there the so-called armory. Its builders, however, spared no material at all and by all accounts it was a huge palace. So we  onclude with a report from the council that took place in 1130 that there was a 3000 person meeting. However, at the end of the 12th century, the building suffered greatly from a huge storm.

But we return to the previously mentioned Vratislav II, who is credited with the fact that we now know what Vyšehrad as it is. His legacy is the building of the Rotunda of St. Martin,
the Basilica of St. Lawrence and certainly the greatest landmark - Saints Peter and Paul. He made Vyšehrad a founding Church chapter directly subordinate to the Pope because he was in dispute with the bishop of Prague - his brother. These disputes resulted in the fact that at Vyšehrad, Vratislav built a palace which, for his own personal safety, moved here from Prague Castle.

His successors later returned to Prague Castle. In Vyšehrad, however, they were still connected and here was the location of the coronation ceremony. On the eve of the celebration the future Emperor worshipped at the estate Přemyslides with lichen shoes and a bag to resemble Přemysl the Ploughman. It was done in order to symbolize the common roots of the ruler. Vyšehrad is truly a place rich in legend so here is one of them. At a time when the Prince Křesomysl ruled, the farm fields were barren. Křesomysl wanted peopled to work in the mines for precious materials in the vicinity of Vyšehrad. Nobody cared about the fields and they were abandoned. But Lord Horymir and his retinue did not like this at all. Horymir went to  Vyšehrad, but the king did not worry about Horymir's problems. What followed then is difficult to understand. When the miners heard of Horymir's complaints, they seized by rage and at night they burned down Horymir's entire village which was outside of the castle. Horymir managed to escape but he vowed to take revenge. Horymir's men rallied and attacked the Birch
mines, where the attackers were from. They killed all the miners and the pit ceased to operate. This of course infuriated Křesomysl. Horymir was trapped and condemned to death by hanging. Horymir however had a plan. His last wish before he died was to ride his horse Semika. Křesomysl agreed to his request, brought the Semika and closed the gates. When Horymir rode through Vyserhrad, an incredible thing happened. He whispered something into Semika's ear and suddenly the horse reared up, made a huge leap over the wall, and finally swam the
river, letting Horymir escape his captors. Křesomysl was so surprised that he decided to forgive Horymir and reconcile with him. Unfortunately Semika suffered serious injuries and
died.

### BASILICA OF SAINTS PETER AND PAUL / BAZILIKA SV.PETRA A PAVLA

A bell towers of Saints Peter and Paul are the dominating feature of Vyšehrad, visible from afar. Today's Neo-Gothic style is from 1902 by Josef Mocker and incorporates the
remnants of Gothic and Romanesque masonry. The important events that are associated with this site indicate that in the year 1070 Vratislav II created the site. Coupled with his royal coronation, the Vyšehrad Chapter was founded in the year 1085- the first royal coronation of a Czech king. Later, Charles IV chose Vyšehrad as the starting point for the Czech king's coronation parade. From this period is preserved in the church a rare plate picture of the Madonna of Vyšehrad called the Rain Madonna. The records say it was used during dry periods during which the procession asked for a weather change and the painting at this time was also included in the famous Emperor Rudolph's collections. A little known attraction of this church is undoubtedly the bells. They were created by perhaps the most famous 16th century Czech bell maker Brikcius of Cymperka- the artistry of the bells earned him an aristocratic coat-of-arms. Along with Brikcius decorated bells conveying Biblical stories, there is an unusual motif of farm work as well, allowing one to see such scenes as sheep shearing,
hoeing fields, or milking cows. The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, according to historical sources, also contains the remains of the first Přemysl Crypt: Vratislav II, his brother Conrad, Soběslav I and II. The excavations, however, still have not confirmed this assumption. The current form of the church from its last renovation from 1902-1903 is by Josef Mocker who built the high towers, removing the previous pseudo-Baroque towers. The relief carved tympanum above the main portal by Stepan Zálešák displays motifs from the Last Judgement. On the facade of the church is a plaque that commemorates the baptism of 14 Czech princes at Regensburg in 845 and is the location where the church's tubular bells which plays several different tunes, always according to the current holiday or important event (are there people playing or are they in the tower?) The interior was decorated by Francis and Vera Urban Art Nouveau figural ornaments. The Presbyterian frescoes are from the Viennese painter Karl Jobst which depict scenes from the lives of SS. Peter and Paul. Josef Mocker designed the main alter of the temple. On the altar in the third chapel, see the above mentioned panel painting of the Rain Madonna. The legend also says that he painted himself as St. Luke. In the first chapel on the right is the tomb of St. Longinus from the 12th century.

### ST. MARTIN ROTUNDA (ROTUNDA SV. MARTINA)

While walking around Vyšehrad, certainly stop at the rotunda of St. Martin. The Rotunda of St. Martin is the oldest rotunda in Prague and dates back to the end of the 11th century, when Prague was ruled by Prince Vratislav II. The walls reach an incredible width of one meter. The rotunda diameter is about sixand-a-half meters. The rotunda was used as a gunpowder 
house during the Thirty Years War. It was renewed as a church in 1719. Unfortunately, after one year the rotunda was damaged again and could nolonger serve its purpose as a church. 
In the second half of the 19th century it was renovated thanks to Earl Chotek. For the interior decoration, the themes which were used are from the Vyserhrad Codex.
The Neo-Renaissance altar rotunda, which is made of Slivenec marble, is decorated with paintings by J. Sequens. Let's focus on the architecture of the ancient sanctuary: On
the central building there is an apse with the unusual parabolic shape of the original walls of the smaller blocks of stone. In 1719, the old Romanesque entrance portal was
replaced with new Baroque tiles. Because of the bombing of Prague and the Prussian army in 1757, the building was badly damaged. In memory of this event, one of the Prussian cannonballs was bricked into its walls, which can be seen there today. In 1784 the Emperor Joseph II ordered it to be used as a warehouse. When the building of a new communications system threatened the Vyšehrad's rotunda with demolition, it is thanks to the Surgeon Earl Chotek that it was saved. The rotunda was then rented as housing for the poor. The was pnctured for a new entry and in the apse a kitchen was built and another hole was made in the ceiling for a chimney. At the end of the 19th century the Vyšehrad canonry bought the building back and it was restored, giving it its most recent form. It has been restored back to its Romanesque origins. A new entry portal was put in, windows covered the lanterns, and an accompanying stucco cornices as well as the windows got new stained-glass panes.

### ST. LAWRENCE BASILICA (BAZILIKA SV. VAVŘINCE)

The masonry of the foundations of St. Lawrence can be seen in the baroque residence No.14 on Sobeslav street, close to the prince's home and the royal acropolis of the medieval castle. The building was originally a three nave design with a transept and semicircular apse. Believed to have been found in the private chapel of Vratislav II, come some of the oldest archaeological finds: tiles that are embossed with motifs of the sphinx, the Emperor Nero, griffin and lion-dog hybrids. These are now on view at St. Lawrence. The basilica was destroyed by the Hussites in 1420 but has since been restored.

### VYSEHRAD CEMETERY (VYŠEHRADSKÝ HŘBITOV A SLAVÍN)

The Vysehrad cemetery forms a dominant part of the Vyšehrad National Cultural Monument. The graves of meritorious personages are concentrated here, many of those who
contributed to Czech culture, education, national selfdetermination and the independence of the country.

Every day, all year round hundreds of visitors from all corners of the Czech Republic and the five continents pay visits to Vyšehrad, the Upper Castle. People who have come from afar often do not have time to go into all the details, and so they tend to be on the lookout for names that are familiar to them. The most frequent cultural link to our country takes
the form of music, and their first visit to the Vyšehrad cemetery takes them to the tomb of Antonín Dvořák. The citizens of the United States often think of him as a founder of their
national music. One motif from his 9th symphony in EMinor, "From the New World" (Largo) became the state anthem of one of the states of the Union - Iowa. Many in Europe and as far as Japan also know the music of Bedřich Smetana. Among writers the best-known to guests not only from the English-speaking countries is Karel Čapek.

Until the early sixties of the nineteenth century, this cemetery covered only a small area in the immediately vicinity of the Church of SS Peter and Paul. After the fall of the absolutist regime that had ruled over the country after the defeat of the revolutionary movement in the year 1848, there occurred a certain detente in political life, and with it began
a tempestuous spread of national self-awareness. One of the forms this took was the longing to set up a common burial place of all those who had made major contributions
to the national renaissance, similar to such places that existed in other great European countries. This idea arose in the patriotic Svatobor Association, founded by the "Father of the Nation", the historian František Palacký in 1862. The selection of the most suitable and most dignified place led to the choice of Vyšehrad, associated with the oldest Czech legends, a lasting source of Czech history described in the oldest chronicles. Beginning in the Romanesque period there is historic proof that Vyšehrad was the residence of Czech princes and kings. One of the most famous of these, Charles IV, King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, stipulated that the Bohemian coronation ceremony should take its starting point in this place.
At the beginning only individual tombs were set up - the first above the grave of writer, librarian and archive-keepe Vácslav Hanka, which lies close to the main entrance. At its
top is the symbol of the Svatobor Association : three hands holding a ring, the symbol of the association logo: Help Enlighten - Remember. Thanks to the efforts of the patriotic priest Václav Štulc, provost of the Vyšehrad Chapter, the existing small burial ground was enlarged until, at the end of the nineteenth century, it reached its present size. Simultaneous with the reconstruction of the Chapter church in NeoGothic style, the cemetery was given artistic form: Half of its perimeter was lined with Neo-Renaissance arcades with ostentatious graves, and in 1893 the dominant feature of the cemetery, the Slavín (Pantheon), the common tomb of the most meritorious personages, was finished. The designer of the arcades and the Pantheon was Antonín Wiehl, disciple and follower of the greatest Czech architect of the 19th century, Josef Zítek, who, among others, built the National Theatre. The construction work was made possible by a gift of a patriotic entrepreneur and mayor of Smíchov, Petr Fischer, who entrusted the property and care to the Svatobor Association, who had initiated the idea of the construction. 

The Pantheon symbolizes the entire sacred ground, where among the thousands who devoted their lives to their families, to crafts, offices and services of their fellow citizens,
there rest personages who stood out among their surroundings by meritorious work for society as a whole, for the nation and their homeland in the spheres of culture, science, the economy, in spiritual service, physical culture, the administration of public affairs, in politics, men and women engraved in our memory by their fate as victims of wars and
persecution. Above their graves there rises the architecture of the Pantheon as a common tomb to those without whose contribution our Czech nation would not have gained its
present-day appearance, level of culture and education. The Vyšehrad cemetery is not a museum with a closed history, as is the case of other cemeteries in Prague, in the
Lesser Town or the older parts of Olšany cemetery, where no burials take place any more. From time to time the sad moment arrives when somebody who has departed for ever
is placed into the sacred ground of Vyšehrad to become immortal through his work and in our memories. The Vyšehrad cemetery and its pantheon are not the sole burial places of all famous men and women who contributed to the memory of the nation and the general public. Many rest elsewhere, as was their last wish or that of their families. Some in their places of birth, others, where they worked and died. Here we shall deal with that selection from our history provided by a short walk through the Vyšehrad.
