## St. Agnes Convent(Anežský klášter)

The convent „Na Františku“ clearly remembers the year 1233 when its foundress Agnes of Přemyslid (Czech: Anežka Přemyslovna) and the king Wenceslas I. were walking here. 
It was established in place of the former hospital. Agnes of Přemyslid rather familiar as St. Agnes of Bohemia (Czech:Svatá Anežka Česká) was the daughter of King Přemysl Otakar I.
She founded this Clarist convent together with her brother and became its first abbess. The sisters from the Italian area Assisi were introduced to the convent just after that.

The huge complex used to be formed by a female branch of the Clarists which was later joined by a male convent of the minor brothers. And what can be found in the premises: The unquestioned dominating point is the convent church of St. Francis (Czech: Kostel sv. Františka), later the monastery of the Minorites, furhter the complex is formed by a large convent wing, the convent kitchen, by the aisle of the female church. Last but not least we need to mention another gem among the gems, namely the chapel of Maria Magdalena, Church
of st. Christ the Saviour, St. Barbara´s Chapel and the house of the abbess. The convent started to decay at the end of the 14th century. The ravages of time was dominating it until the end of 1556 when it became the possession of the Dominicans. It was their credit that the Clarist convent was reconstructedand rebuilt in the Renaissance style. Finally the Clarists came back again. It was affected by a destroying fire at the end of the 17th century and after the damages had been repaired people found themselves in front of the object in the style of the mature Baroque. During the Josephine dissolution of the conventsthe reform afflicted also this place. The convent has been a national cultural landmark since 1978. And what can we see here these days? The convent is currently the residence of one of the parts of the Prague National Gallery. Therefore you can see here the exposition called the Medieval arts in
Bohemia and Central Europe 1200-1550. So do not hesitate and come to visit the places where the significant Czech monarchs rest.

## St. Castullus Church(Kostel sv. Haštala)

The main point of Haštalské náměstí (Hastal/Castullus Square) is a forty-meter-high prismatic tower attached to the Gothic church which comes from the 14th century. The church received
a remarkable Baroque modification later in the period 1689 -1695. Another rarity is to be found inside the church. A two aisle hall with the slender columns and rib vaults were built here. This structural element is distinguished as the fines manifestation of the Prague´s Gothic architecture.
So if we count well during our visit we will get the total of four aisles.

## Ministry of Industry and Trade (Ministerstvo průmyslu a obchodu)

We are now reaching the Vltava embankment with beautiful views of the other bank of the river and Prague Castle. The first building we want to introduce here is the exemplary locations of one of the ministries of the newly established Czechoslovak Republic after World War I. The Ministry of Industry and Trade, one of the most important state authorities, needed five to six thousand square meters for its agenda, still in the city center. Such a building commission was not decidedly easy for an architect. Architect Josef Fanta, one of the most prominent Czech architects, has advised about it more than well. Not only did he meet all the building requirements, but he created one of the most beautiful buildings of that period. The three-story building is built on a basic rectangular ground plan with self-supporting walls and stone facades of granite and sandstone. The main entrance comes into the foreground and in
the upper part there are several life-size sculptures. They are meant to symbolize Industry, Trade, Crafts and Navigation. The sculptural decoration of the building contains a total of 120 statues representing various other skills, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and more.

The Ministry building is dominated by a glazed dome at the very top of the building, and massive towers on the sides. If you enter the building, you will find yourself in a large stairwell courtyard from marble tiling. Everything is illuminated by stained glass and a three-part window. Be sure to have a look.

## The Rudolfinum (Rudolfinum)

The Rudolfinum was constructed between 1876 – 1881. The contemporary Jan Palach Square was determined to be the right place for that exceptional building. The construction was performed
under direction of architects Josef Zítek and Josef Schulz. They created a unique neorenaissance building that due to its opulence and grandiosity could not be used for any other but representative purposes. In honour of the successor of the Habsbourg throne, Archduke Rudolf, the building was called the Rudolfinum. The Rudolfinum was mainly used for important cultural events, concerts and exhibitions. There are nearly one thousand rooms behind the walls of the Rudolfinum.

Richly decorated exhibition spaces are accompanied by representative chambers. However, let´s peep into the most prestigious part of the Rudolfinum. It is the so-called Dvořákova síň (Dvo-řák Hall) which due to its gorgeous decorations and perfect acoustics became the scene of the most important concerts and social events. They are performed either at Suk or Kubelík Hall. At present the building is a residence of the Czech Philharmonic and the Rudolfinum Gallery.
