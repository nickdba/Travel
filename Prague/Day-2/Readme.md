# DAY 2

## Old Town (Staré Město)

Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí) – You haven’t really
been to Prague unless you’ve stepped foot in its most recognisable
square! The Old Town Square has been Prague’s beating heart since
the 12th century.

Astronomical Clock (Pražský orloj) – For over 600 years this
intriguing gem of Prague has been attracting visitors to marvel at its
hourly Procession of the Apostles. Keep your eyes peeled for the
spooky dancing skeleton that represents death! This amazing
timepiece not only keeps track of the day, week and month but also
Babylonian time.

Church of Our Lady Upon Tyn (Chrám Matky Boží před Týnem) –
Towering over Old Town Square since the 14th century, this Gothicstyle church 
is easily recognisable from many vantage points across
the city.

Jan Hus Monument (Pomník Mistra Jana Husa) – Popular
amongst locals today as well as during his time, Hus was burned at
the stake in 1415 for opposing Vatican control over the local church.
He is a symbol of standing up against oppression, which may be why
locals would quietly sit contemplating by his feet during the
Communist rule of Czechloslovakia!

Goltz Kinsky Palace (palác Kinských) – Breathtaking and in
Rococo-style this palace is the former residence of the Goltz family in the 18th century. 
Today it houses the National Gallery.

Clementinum (Klementinum)
A very underrated Prague attraction, at Klementinum you’ll be able to
follow in the footsteps of Galileo, Tycho and Kepler at the Astronomical
Tower (not to be confused with the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town
Square). Into astronomy? Take a closer look at some of Galileo’s original
scientific instruments Kepler and Tycho used to make history gazing into the heavens.
This significant event must have been the prophecy that Princess Libuše foresaw.
Visiting the Astronomical Tower at Klementinum can only be done via a
guided tour which is definitely worth the 45 minutes for your time. The
tour also allows you access to the Meridian Hall and Baroque Library Hall,
which is considered the most beautiful library in the world (keep in mind
you won’t be allowed to take photos in there though, unfortunately).
