The palace was built in the second half of the 16th century by the Czech nobleman Jaroslav of Pernštejn (1528–1569) and completed by his brother, Vratislav of Pernštejn (1530–1582), the chancellor of the Czech Kingdom. It was opened to the public for the first time on 2 April 2007 as the Lobkowicz Palace Museum. Set in 22 galleries, the museum displays a selection of pieces from the Lobkowicz Collections, including works by artists such as Antonio Canaletto, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Diego Velázquez, as well as decorative art, military and hunting paraphernalia, musical instruments, and original manuscripts and early prints of composers including Beethoven and Mozart.

### Old Royal Palace

The original residence building, mostly wooden, was built at Prague Castle already at the turn of the 9th and 10th century. Its exact location is not documented. It was prince Soběslav in the 12th century who had a stone Romanesque palace built right next to a new fortification wall. Remains of it have been preserved in the underground till the present times. The palace was adjoined on its eastern side by All Saints' Chapel, which was consecrated in 1185.

In the first half of the 14th century, the king and emperor Charles IV enlarged the Romanesque building and so a Gothic palace with a vaulted interior for state purposes and a band of arcades on its northern side came to be. During the reign of his son Wenceslas IV, two perpendicular wings were added and All Saints' Chapel was reconstructed.

The palace was deserted for entire eighty years of the stormy 15th century. After 1483, the king Vladislav Jagiello returned to Prague Castle and commenced the last large-scale reconstruction of the palace. The magnificent solemn Vladislav Hall was added to it and when designing it, the architect Benedikt Ried combined the art of the Late Gothic with elements of the newly arriving Renaissance style. The perpendicular palace wing named after Vladislav's son Ludvig is also the work of B. Ried. After the succession of the Habsburgs to the Bohemian throne, the interiors of the Old Royal Palace were used for coronation festivities and diets and as conference rooms, offices and depositories. New dwelling quarters were built to the west of the palace, in the southern part of the Castle complex. After the catastrophic fire which occurred in 1541, the Diet and All Saints' Church were rebuilt.

From the 16th century, the Vladislav Hall served particularly royal state purposes. It was the scene of coronation festivities and banquets, knights' tournaments and markets with artistic and luxurious goods. The Vladislav Hall still partly fulfils the state function: the elections of the president of the Czech Republic used to take place there and ceremonial gatherings connected with important days in the life of this country are held there still.

Neighbouring on the Vladislav Hall is the Diet, which through the furnishings of its interior affords an idea of the way in which the proceedings of the Diet took place after 1627, and also All Saints' Church. From the south-western corner of the Vladislav Hall a portal leads to the Ludwig Wing with the offices of the Czech Chancellery. In 1618, its second room witnessed the beginning of the uprising of the Czech Estates when two governors and a scribe were thrown into the Castle ditch from its window. The uprising of the Czech Estates was the first conflict of the Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648).

The observation gallery on the southern wall of the Vladislav Hall affords a beautiful view of the Garden on the Ramparts and of Prague.

Nowadays, the exit from the Vladislav Hall is formed by the Riders' Staircase, built originally to enable knights to enter the hall on horseback in order to take part in the jousting competitions held in it. The staircase is vaulted with a complicated Late Gothic rib vault.

All Saints' Church
The All Saints' Church was built by Petr Parler on the site of the Romanesque palace chapel, also consecrated to All Saints. According to old sources, the church was magnificently decorated in the manner of Sainte Chapelle in Paris. However, after the great fire of 1541, only its peripheral walls remained.

In the course of its renewal, the church was extended as far as the facade of the Vladislav Hall and during later modifications it was connected with it by means of a portal.

### St. George's Basilica

St. George's Basilica originated as the second church at Prague Castle. Only parts of the building, founded about 920 by Prince Vratislav I have been preserved. When the convent of Benedictine nuns was founded in 973, the church was enlarged and reconstructed.

The present Romanesque appearance of the church with main apse and two steeples dates back to the time of the reconstruction carried out after the devastating fire which occurred in 1142. In the first half of the 13th century, a chapel consecrated to St. Ludmila was added to the church as well as a portico on its western side. The Early Baroque period left its mark in the form of the present striking facade and the reconstruction of the whole convent. In the early 18th century, the architect F.M. Kanka added the Baroque Chapel of St. John Nepomuk to the church. After the devastating occupation of the convent by troops in the late 18th century, the church was renewed in the years 1887 to 1908 after the design by F. Mach, who tried to restore its Romanesque appearance. In the period from 1969 to 1975 the convent was also reconstructed and adapted for the installation of the exposition of old Bohemian art of the National Gallery. Now, the Convent is used for short-term exhibitions.

The interior of the basilica is Romanesque, austere and monumental. The tombs of members of the ruling Premyslid dynasty are situated in the main nave. One of them belongs to prince Vratislav, father of St. Wenceslas.

### The Golden Lane 

The Golden Lane originated after the construction of a new northern wall of the Castle. The area of the northern bailey was used for the building of modest dwellings, which are now the last remainder of the small-scale architecture of Prague Castle.

They were inhabited by defenders of the Castle, servants or for example goldsmiths and the Castle marksmen. The tiny houses were occupied until World War II, but already during the period of the First Republic, care was taken to ensure that the picturesque character of the Lane was not changed in the course of modifications. From 1916 to 1917 house No. 22 was inhabited by the writer Franz Kafka.

The appearance of a 16th-century dwelling is best demonstrated by house No. 13, which is a Renaissance home of a member of the guard, so called "Red Musket". In the neighbouring house, No. 14, there lived before World War II a famous fortune-teller "Madame de Thebes", whose clientele was both local and from overseas as is documented in her correspondence. Because of her predictions of a near fall of the Third Reich, she was arrested by the German secret police and died during an interrogation.

The name of the Lane is derived from goldsmiths who used to live there, as can be seen in the house No. 15. In the 16th century, the name "Goldsmith Lane" has been documented which later changed to the present "Golden Lane".

The staircase in house No. 12 affords access to the terrace in front of the tower called Daliborka. This round cannon tower formed a part of the Jagiello fortification system and its bottom floor was used as a prison. The first and also the best-known prisoner was the knight Dalibor of Kozojedy, who was imprisoned here in 1498.

A sister of writer Franz Kafka rented the house number 22 in the summer of 1916; Kafka used this house to write for approximately one year.

### Daliborka Tower

At the eastern end of the Golden Lane stands a round tower, shrouded in legend. Dating back to 1496, the tower, which served as a prison until 1781, is named after its first inmate – Dalibor of Kozojedy. According to a legend, Dalibor learned to play violin in the prison and with his music earned not only money but also sympathies​ of local people.

In addition to the dungeon with its monumental vaults, there is a circular opening in the floor through which offenders were lowered into the oubliette with the help of a pulley. The Daliborka Tower is part of the Prague Castle guided tour.

### St. Vitus Cathedral

St. Vitus Cathedral is the largest and the most important temple in Prague. Apart from religious services, coronations of Czech kings and queens also took place here. The cathedral is a place of burial of several patron saints, sovereigns, noblemen and archbishops.

The cathedral is the third church consecrated to the same saint on the same site. Around the year 925, Prince Wenceslas (Václav) founded a Romanesque rotunda here, which after 1060 was converted into a basilica with three naves and two steeples. The importance of the church grew especially after the establishment of the Prague bishopric in 973 and the founding of the body of canons - the St. Vitus chapter, which later became an important cultural and administrative institution.

In 1344, Charles IV began the construction of a Gothic cathedral. Its first builders, Matthias of Arras and later Peter Parler, built the chancel with a ring of chapels, St. Wenceslas Chapel, the Golden Gate and the lower part of the Great South Tower. It was already Peter Parler who started the construction of the South Tower, however he did not complete it. In the 16th century, is was finished with a Renaissance view gallery and a helmet. Later in the 18th century, the older helmet was replaced by a new dome.

Unfortunately, in 1419 the construction of the Cathedral stopped because of the Hussite Wars. In spite of the endeavours of some sovereigns to secure the continuation of the construction work, the Cathedral remained uncompleted for whole centuries. The facade of the Cathedral was provisionally closed and for example the music choir was bulit.

It was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the Union for the Completion of the Cathedral began the repair of the original part and the completion of the Cathedral in Neo-Gothic style. The church was solemnly consecrated in 1929. Its interior was subjected to adaptations even in later years.

Visitors enter the Cathedral through the portal in the western facade, opposite the passage-way between the Second and Third Courtyard of Prague Castle.

Its bronze door is decorated with reliefs with scenes from the history of the Cathedral and from the legends about St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert.

The Neo-Gothic part of the Cathedral consists of the main nave and the narrow side aisles, lined with chapels, and the northern wing of the transverse nave. The chapels have stained glass windows. In the cross nave, the ceremonial entrance into the Cathedral can be seen - the Golden Gate - leading to the Third Courtyard.

Situated in the chancel of the Cathedral, in front of the high altar, is the Royal Mausoleum below which there is the royal crypt. The chancel is surrounded by a ring of Gothic chapels. Czech sovereigns and patron saints are interred in some of them.

St. Wenceslas Chapel is a cult centre of St. Vitus Cathedral. Its magnificent decoration and the different conception of its architecture emphasize its singularity as the central point of the Cathedral with the tomb of the most important Czech patron saint. The facing of the walls, consisting of precious stones, and the wall paintings of the Passion Cycle are parts of the original 14th-century decoration of the chapel. The scenes from the life of St. Wenceslas forming another decorative band are attributed to the workshop of the Master of the Litomerice Altar (the cycle dates back to 1509).

The door in the south-western corner of the chapel leads to the Crown Chamber in which the Bohemian Coronation Jewels are kept.

### Royal Garden

The originally Renaissance garden founded in 1534 became one of the few quiet places in the centre of Prague. The garden is located on the site of old medieval vineyards.

Royal Garden was commissioned by the Habsburg Ferdinand I. From the owners he gradually bought old vineyards beyond the valley of the Brusnice stream and had a Renaissance garden laid out here, which later became famous for its rare botanical specimens and the exotic plants gained from distant countries. From the very beginning, there were situated a number of buildings serving the entertainment of the nobility: the Ball Game Hall, the Royal Summer Palace, the Lion Court. Currently the garden follows the tradition of an "English-style" park created there in the mid 19th century, but it also contains elements of Renaissance character (giardinetto near the Royal Summer Palace) as well as Baroque elements (ornamental flower beds). It can be approached via three entrances: two western gates from the street U Prašného mostu and the northern gate near the Royal Summer Palace.

### The South Gardens

The South Gardens were established gradually on the location of bulwarks beneath Prague Castle. The last renovation in 2012 restored their original appearance from 1920's when they were renovated by the Slovenian architekt Josip Plečnik for the first Czechoslovak president T. G. Masaryk.

The South Gardens are nearly 500 metres long and in the summer tourist season it is possible to enter them from Opyš near the eastern gate or via the Bull Staircase from the Third Courtyard. The west gate between Hradčany Square (Hradčanské náměstí) and the South Gardens is for exit only. The South Gardens are comprised of three smaller gardens.

Paradise Garden
The garden is situated on the spot of the oldest garden in front of the southern wall of the Castle, where a private garden of Archduke Ferdinand used to be in the fifties of the 16th century. Similarly, the emperor Rudolf II also had his private garden here with a bath or for example an aviary. Architect Plečnik designed its current image in 1920's. A monumetal straircase and a big granite bowl became its dominants. On one site the stone border even changes course to bypass probably one of the oldest trees at Prague Castle - a yew tree with the estimated age of about 400 years.

Garden on the Ramparts
The name of the garden refers to an old rampart on the southern side of the Castle where later small gardens were founded to be turned into a natural park in the 19th century. In 1849, a fortification wall was built around the area and can still be seen there, although it has been lowered in 1920's during the renovations of Josip Plečnik. The garden has a unified geometric appearance and it runs beneath most of the southern face wall of Prague Castle. Its central terrace offers a breathtaking view of Prague. At the end of the gardens there is the so called Moravian Bastion, a secluded place where T. G. Masaryk liked to sit.

Hartig Garden
The Hartig Garden with a Music Pavilion is the smallest of the gardens on the southern side of the Castle and it was connected to them in 1960's. Its current image hails back to 1965 to the design by architects Adolf Bens and Richard Podzemny. The garden is closed for public.

### Stag Moat

The Stag Moat a natural ravine of the Brusnice stream. It got its name because of breeding of deer here in the 17th century.
It was possible to see deer in the Moat till the 18th century. This tradition was symbolically followed in the 20th century, when a bear pen was founded there. Between 2001 and 2007, a tunnel after the design of architect J. Pleskot was bulit through the embankment between the Upper and the Lower Moat. The Stag Moat is open to public in the summer season.

## The Lesser Town / Malá Strana

The Lesser Town was the second part of Prague to be established after the Old Town. It was created by King Přemysl Otakar II in 1257, mainly to beef up the defences surrounding the castle. The first inhabitants of the Lesser Town were settlers from northern Germany. The area underwent extensive development during the reign of Charles IV. He enlarged it considerably and put up defensive walls, a part of which is called the Hungerall, which can still be seen today at the top of Petřín Hill.

From the outset there were a large number of religious sites in the small area the Lesser Town occupies. This concentration of churches led at the beginning of the Hussite wars in 1419 to the complete plunder of the LesserTown. The Hussites attacked the royal barracks and burnt down the Archbishop’s court and half the district went with it. The Lesser Town had only just recovered when another disaster struck. In 1541 a huge fire broke out on this side of the river, practically razing the area to the ground. It was only after this did the Lesser Town acquire its current appearance which differs so much from the Old Town. Around the castle huge resi-dences were constructed and the nobility built luxury palaces. These buildings were mainly baroque in style. In the 17th century, residences such as the Valdštejn, Nostitz, Michnovsky and Furstenberg Palaces were built. Architects such as Kilian Ignac Dienzenho-
fer, Anselmo Lurago, Giovanni Domenico Orsi and many other famous names worked there. The beauty of the Mala Strana was heightened by the creation of numerous gardens and terraced slo-
pes, an architectural speciality of central Europe.

### Wallenstein Palace / Valdštejn Palac

The Wallenstein Palace, a long block standing opposite the Ledeburg Palace, was one of the first baroque buildings to appear in Prague. It was built by Duke Albrecht von Wallenstein, Emperor Ferdinand II’s generalissimo, as his private residence. Albrecht von Wallenstein became a legendary figure during the Thirty Year’s War. During the struggle between the Czech Estates and the Habsburg monarchy, he cleverly sided with the king, confiscating property of the defeated Czech nobility for himself. Wallenstein was a slippery character who, in the course of the war, managed to change sides several times, but always with an eye on gaining property. When he actually began to consider taking the imperial crown away from the Habsburgs, the emperor had him murdered in Cheb in 1634, to the relief of many.

The Valdštejn Palace was intended to compete with the royal palace in grandness and size. The Italian architects Spezza, Marini, Pieronni and Sebregondi all worked on this monumental baroque structure. The main, 60m long fasade is fairly simple and is more Renaissance in character, but the arrival of the new baroque style can be seen on the three entranceways, of which the middle one is false. Inside, the highlight of the palace is the remarkable Main Hall which is two storeys high. It is decorated with stucco work and ceiling frescoes by Italian Baccio Bianco depicting Wallenstein himself as the god Mars. The Chapel of St Wenceslas boasts the oldest baroque altar in Prague dating from 1630. Adjoining the main building of the palace is the sala terrena, in front of which extends the Valdštejn Garden, a baroque Frenchstyle park. The sala terrena is a huge hall, full of columns and decorated with stucco and paintings depicting scenes from the Trojan Wars (1629 – 30), again by Baccio Bianco. To the right is a manmade dripstone cave. From the sala terrena one can see the Venus Fountain and a row of bronze statues by Adrian de Vries, regarded as the best example of Mannierism in Europe. Sadly, they are copies as the originals were carted off by Swedish troops in 1648. In the rear section of the garden visitors will find a pool full of fish, in the centre of which stands de Vries’s Hercules. Beyond the pool stands the old riding school, now used by the National Gallery for temporary exhibitions.

The builing now houses the Senate of the Czech Republic and the gardens with free entrace are considered the most beautiful in Prague. Enter the gardens through the small door from Letenska street.

### Palace Gardens under Prague Castle

These gardens are located in places where in the Middle Ages one would have found vineyards growing on the steep northern approaches to Prague Castle. In the 16th century, the nobility began to construct palaces and terraced gardens here. It deals with almost the whole area under Prague Castle between Wallenstein Square and Klárov. All the palace terrace gardens have rich architectural decorations, decorative staircases, balustrades, lookout terraces, gloriettes and pavilions combined with vegetation into picturesque wholes. It is a magnificent view of Prague. Go along the stairs to Prague Castle, and you can relax. The three gardens, which once belonged to the Ledeburg, Furstenberg and Palffy palaces, were joined together to form a single garden. The Fūrstenberg Garden was created in 1784 by Ignac Palliardi. On the upper terrace there is a pavilion, decorated with statues and classic vases. The small house with the bulbous tower high up on the hill once housed a spa for the owner, Barbora Černinova. The Palffy Garden isn’t as richly adorned, but one can still find a unique sundial painted at the top of the covered staircase. The Ledeburg Garden boasts a stunning sala terrena by architects Jan Santini and Giovanni Battista Alliprandi. The gardens are accessed from the Palffy Palace in Valdštejnske Square and are well worth a visit.

### St. Thomas Church

The impulse to found the St. Thomas Church was given by the Czech King Wenceslas II. This pious monarch was thus the initiator of the founding of the gorgeous Gothic church in the middle of the Lesser Town. Already from the distance you can see the high church tower, one of the dominating features of the church. St. Thomas Church allong with St. Nicholas Church belong to significant Baroque monuments of the Lesser Town. The originally Gothic church of St. Thomas was built on the foundations of an old Romanic church. The church was consecrated in 1379. It had to face the uneasy fate in the Hussite period when the local monks were chased out and the church burnt down. The church was reconstructed thank to the Augustinian Hermits allong with the architect Bernard die Alberto btw.

1584-1592. Another fire affected it in the 16th century and this time also the church gallery collapsed. The Renaissance reconstruction was completed at the end of the 17th century. The Order of the Augustinians called for the new reconstruction the architect Kilián Ignác Dientzenhofer whose designs are responsible for the current Baroque appearance.
Do not forget to look at the main altar during your seightseeing of the church interior. Here you can see the painting The Martyrdom of St. Thomas by Peter Paul Rubens. But it is just a replica of the painting if you want to see the original you need to visit the National Gallery of Prague. If you visit the former capitular hall,.i.e. the current Chapel
of St. Dorothy you can adore the paintings by Josef Heintz there. The lovers of the art visiting the church will certainly be satisfied – another treasures are the paintings by Karel Škréta. The crypt which is located in the internals of the church belongs to its chief curiosities and makes the place so much popular with the tourists. Many significant people found their place of the last piece here. Among the most noted ones belongs e.g. Adrian de Vries. We know his name from the walks through the Valdštejn Garden because he was the author of
the sculptural decorations. In case you find it his grave it is located in St. Barbara´s Chapel. The Valdštejn Garden is situated right beside the church where you can see the works of this great sculptor. Another significant person is the architect Ulrik Aostalli alias Aegidius Sadeler. This noted engraver and graphic designer was active also at the court of Rudolph II. He was the master of the chiaroscuro art and also published the map of Bohemia at the beginning of the 17th century.

### Lesser town square

See the picture map of the square.

A square has been located in this part of Prague since the foundation of the Lesser Town District in the 13th century. It was originally a marketplace, divided into two parts by  buildings in the middle. Most of the houses on the square have Gothic foundations with Renaissance and baroque upper floors and facades. But most of them disappeared after the devastating
fire of 1541 and were replaced by noble residences. The dominant feature of today’s square is the most beautiful Baroque church in Prague: St. Nicholas Cathedral. We describe it for you in another article. We will now focus on the surrounding buildings and palaces. And we will go clockwise. 

Lesser Town Hall / Malostranská radnice. On the corner of Letenská Street and the Lesser Town Square stands the Lesser Town Hall from 1478. Here, decisions were made on city administration, criminal and civil cases. The building is known for the year 1575, when the so-called Czech Confession was written here. It was a memorandum of understanding allowing religious freedom in Czechia. Something completely unique in this time in Europe. The commemorative plaque of this event is located in the town hall. 

Kaiserstein Palace / Kaiserštejnský palác is a bit further on the corner with Mostecká Street. The most famous Czech opera singer Ema Destinová lived In this palace several years before World War I, who became especially famous abroad. She was the prima dona at the Berlin Opera, engaged in the Metropolitan Opera in New York, singing alongside Enrico Caruso. Today,
you can also find her memorial plaque.

### St. Nicholas Cathedral / Chrám sv. Mikuláše. 

If you would like to see Prague through the eyes of secret service agents, you have a unique opportunity. All you have to do is to climb the tower of St. Nicholas Cathedral. 215 stairs, up to 65 meters. Originally a tower in which an announcer lived, whose task was to ring it during a fire. In the 1950’s during the era of socialism, there was a secret State Security observatory, which monitored movements from nearby Western embassies. Today this observatory is made available to the public along with its equipment.

The Church of St Nicholas dominates Malostranske Square. The church is one of the most exquisite baroque buildings anywhere in Europe and is built on the grand principle of interlocking ellipsoids. Building work was begun on the church in 1703 on the site of an earlier Gothic church dedicated to the same saint. The order behind the building of a new place of worship was the Jesuits, who acquired the site through one of the most influential men in the country, Albrecht von Wallenstein. It was such an important building project that Emperor Leopold I.
himself came to lay the first stone. In the first phase of construction Kryštof Dientzenhofer demonstrated his remarkable skills as a builder. He is responsible for the nave and the side
chapels. The dynamic 40 m high twisting facade and huge interior were the first architectural experiment of its kind on a baroque building in Europe. 
Kryštof’s son Kilian Ignac Dienzenhofer, who took over the project when his father died, built the presbytery with its huge dome. After him, Anselmo Lurago added the slender spire in 1751-56. One enters the church via an entrance, above which the Kolowrat coat of arms tells allcomers that they were significant benefactors when the church was being built.

The vast ceiling fresco in the nave called The Glory of St Nicholas is by Jan Lukaš Kracker, and whit 1500m2 it one of the largest in Europe. It said about the fresco that he the painter was working on it, he didn’t want anybody watching him. He only wanted the work to be seen when it was finished. But one of the Jesuit monks was so curious that would hide behind one of the church pillars to watch. However, the painter caught sight of him, and as a punishment he included him in the fresco as a figure hiding behind a pillar watching everything. When the painter was finished and everyone was let in to admire the work, they couldn’t stop laughing when they recognised their colleague on the ceiling! The fresco in the dome is the work of František Xaver Palko and depicts the Glory of the Holy Trinity. Palko was the most celebrated artist of his time with the possible exception of V. V. Reiner. The dome is 70m high and  the spire next to it reaches 79m into the Prague skyline. The nave is adorned with numerous late baroque sculptures, mainly by Ignac František Platzer. Probably the most noteworthy works of art in the entire church are paintings by Karel Škreta–The Crucifixion from the mid 17th century in the Chapel of St Barbora and the Passion Cycle in the church gallery. In 1773, after the abolition of the Jesuit Order, the Church of St Nicholas became the main parish church of the Mala Strana.


Liechtenstein Palace / Lichtejnštejsnký palác. Most of the western side of the square, across from the entrance to the St. Nicholas Cathedral is occupied by Liechtenstein Palace. In the years 1622-23, its owner was Prince Charles of Liechtenstein, nicknamed the “bloody vice regent”. He was the author and executor of punishing the leaders of the estate uprising after
the Battle of White Mountain, which we mentioned several times. He was very ruthless. In vain, the members of the convicted walked to the palace asking for mercy. They all ended up on the executioner’s scaffolding in the Old Town Square. Here you can also see a reminder of those 27 executed in the form of 27 stylized cast iron heads on the cornerstones at the curb in front of the palace. In 1848 there was the main military tent of General Windischgrätz and from there he repressed rebel insurgents throughout Austria - Hungary.

### Nerudova Street / Nerudova ulice. 

This steep, picturesque street is the main road linking the Mala Strana and Hradčany. It was once part of the Royal Way, the route sovereigns would follow up to Prague Castle on the day of their coronation. The street has a distinctly baroque appearance, but many of the houses date back to medieval times. The street, originally called Strahovska at the lower end and Ostruhova at the top end, was renamed at the end of the 19th century after the writer and journalist Jan Neruda who spent a part of his life in the street, and who wrote about the Mala Strana in many of his books. This street is well known for its house symbols. House symbols were an everyday sight until Austrian Empress Maria  Theresa had the houses numbered. They made the houses distinguishable from those around them and often told a great deal about the status, occupation or name of the owner. 

Morzin Palace / Morzinský palác. (No. 5) 
This baroque palace on the lefthand side of Nerudova Street replaced four old houses and was given its current appearance by Giovanni Santini in 1713-14. The fasade was decorated by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff with statues of Moors, allegorical busts representing Day and Night and statues representing the four continents known to antiquity (Europe, Asia, America and Africa). The Morzinsky Palace now houses the Romanian Embassy.a plaque of Mihai Viteazu.

House U TŘÍ HOUSLIČEK (No. 12) (House of the Three Little Violins). Just the name tells us that three families of Prague violin makers lived here, one after the other. The house facade is decorated with paintings of Greek gods. Another interesting dwelling is the Renaissance House U ZLATÉ ČÍŠE (No.16) (House of the olden Chalice). As the name suggests, it was owned
by a goldsmith. 

The House U ST. JANA NEPOMUCKÉHO (No.18) (House of St John of Nepomuk), originally a Renaissance building, was given a baroque face in the early 18th century. The entrance is decorated with a relief of St John of Nepomuk from the beginning of the 18th century. 

Thun - Hohenstein Place / Palác Thun – Hohensteinský (No. 20). Now the Italian Embassy, this palace was built in 1721-26 by Giovanni Santini, originally for the Kolowrat family. Matthias Bernard Braun placed two gigantic eagles beside the entrance, symbols of the Kolowrat family. Above the entrance he put statues representing Jupiter and Junona. The staircase inside the palace was rebuilt in 1871 by Josef Zitek. It is lined with paintings of various stages of human life from the cradle to the grave by Josef Tulka and František Ženišek (who designed the curtain at the National Theatre)

Midway up the street, notice the green house that protrudes from the row and makes the street quite narrow. This house was originally joined onto the Strahov Gate. In the Middle Ages, the Mala Strana town walls ran through the street at this point. The house is now a tea room. Legend has it that every Friday night a firey team of horses thunders through this place, on which sits a headless skeleton waiting for his soul to be released from damnation, but nobody knows how to set him free. Approximately midway up Nerudova Street stands the monastery and the CHURCH OF OUR LADY OF UNCEASING SUCCOUR dating from the 18th cen tury and probably built by architects Jean B. Mathey and Jan Blažej Santini. The church is decorated with statues by Matěj Vaclav Jaeckl. 

One of the last houses at the top of Nerudova Street is the HOUSE U DVOU SLUNCŮ (No. 47) (House of the Two Suns), where the writer Jan Neruda lived from 1845-57. The last house at the top of the hill is called U ZLATÉ HVĚZDY (House of the Golden Star). Here the streets veers to the right and becomes KE HRADU Street. This street was driven through rock in 1638-44, in order to give better access to the castle. Immediately above Ke Hradu
Street towers the Renaissance Schwarzenberg Palace in Hradčanske Square

### The Vrtba Garden / Vrtbovská zahrada 

This garden is said to be the most beautiful palace baroque garden north of the Alps. And definitely worthseeing. The entrance to it is inconspicuous, through the passage of house no. 25, on the left side of Karmelitská Street, just behind the junction with Tržiště Street. František Maxmilián Kaňka deserves credit for the appearance of this garden, since he was employed in the years 1715 - 1720 by Count Jan Josef Vrtba, who held the office of the highest burgrave Prague Castle. Kaňka deserved credit not only the rebuilding of the palace in  which the Count resided, but also the creation of the unique baroque garden that surrounded it. With the help of the perfect sculptural art of Matyáš Bernard Braun and thanks to the frescoes of Václav Vavřinec Reiner, a beautiful area was created, which until now has been considered one of the most attractive gardens of its kind.

In the garden, reaching a maximum of two hundred and twelve meters and an area of ​​0.31 hectares, you can see the unique shrubs and trees that comprise the magnificent appearance of the garden besides the beautiful ancient statues and frescoes. The Vrtba Garden is comprised of terraces with three levels of height, each of which has a unique view ahead before you. These terraces are connected by wide stairways and intertwine. This allows you a bird’s eye view, for example of Prague Castle, St. Nicholas Cathedral or the further Tyn Cathedral. During the walk do not miss the unique decoration of the terrace hall (garden hall), which depicts Venus and Adonis by Václav Vavřinec Reiner. The terrace hall forms a kind of connection between the adjacent palace and the garden. Other attractions worth seeing are the swimming pool in the lower part of the garden where the putti (baby) statuette is placed on the sea monster
and the aviary built into the palace wall.

### Church of Our Lady Victorious and The Infant Jesus of Prague / Kostel Panny Marie Vítězné a Pražské Jezulátko

The Lesser Town Church of Our Lady of Victory is probably the most famous Prague Church in the world. There is the famous statue of the Infant Jesus of Prague, known in Catholic countries as the Bambino di Praga. The statue arrived to Prague from Spain in the 16th century as the property of the court lady Marie Manriquez de Lara, a noblewoman from one of the
most important Spanish families and the wife of the Supreme Chancellor of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Vratislav of Pernštejn. The statuette, according to the Spanish family tradition, passed from mother to daughter as a protector of the family fireplace. Mary’s daughter, known as Polyxena of Lobkovic, had only one son, and so like a faithful Catholic, he donated this rare wax
statue to the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites at the Church of Our Lady of Victory. Since then, many miracles have been associated with the statue.

The order of the Discalced Carmelites was very hard. Its members lived only from alms, and very often they had nothing to eat. At a time when they suffered from the most squalor and poverty, they received a small statue of the Infant Jesus from Polyxena of Lobkovic, saying that she was giving them the most valuable thing she had and, if they would honor the statue, would no longer suffer from penury. The monks regularly prayed to the Infant Jesus. And their lives began to change. Soon the Emperor ordered for the monastery to receive money and food. Even the monastery vineyards began to be fertile. The statue miraculously helped during the plague epidemics, rescuing the monastery against pillaging several times. During the 30’s
however, it was lost for several years. It was at the time when he Carmelites were transferred to Germany, and nobody cared about the Infant Jesus. After their return in 1638, the church was devastated and destroyed. The Infant Jesus sculpture was discovered behind an altar with damaged hands, but otherwise in a surprisingly good condition. It was repaired and the monastery began to flourish again. The Infant Jesus began to be carried in the processions and in 1655 was officially crowned by the Prague bishop as miraculous. This reputation has spread throughout the world. To date, thousands of people travel to the church, asking the Infant Jesus for help, healing, the birth of a child. Others return to thank the statue for fulfilling their plea. The statue is the most worshiped in Spain, Italy and Latin America. 400 years ago a copy of the statue of the Infant Jesus of Prague even helped unify the Philippines. Thanks to it the missionaries reconciled fighting parties. The Church of Our Lady of Victory was built between 1611 and 1612 by German Lutherans and was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. During the re-Catholization after 1621 the Lutherans from the church were banished and the church was donated by Emperor Ferdinand II as a reward for the order of the Decalced Carmelites who helped the Emperor’s army in the Battle of the White Mountain. The Carmelites rebuilt the church, changed its disposition, dedicated it to the Virgin Mary of Victory and built a monastery here.

All this to distinguish themselves from the Protestants. Most of the works that decorate the interior of the church arose in the 17th and 18th centuries. Besides the Infant Jesus of Prague, the most important works are paintings by Petr Brandl. The Prophet Elijah can be found in the chancel, St. John the Baptist. Joseph, Simon, Jachym and Anna on the side altars. The
statues here are from Jan Jiří Bendl. The main altar is characterized by its alternation of gold and black. An interesting part of the church is also its crypt. Over 200 people were buried here between 1666 and 1716. Mostly Carmelites and their supporters. The crypt was damaged several times in the past by water and is unfortunately now inaccessible. But you can see
the Infant Jesus at any time. In these places you can also find yourself under Petřín Hill, which offers beautiful views of Prague Castle and all Prague. On top of the hil, you can climb to the Petřín lookout tower, which is a 5x smaller replica of the Paris Eiffel Tower. If you want to look at it, go straight through Karmelitska Street to the right of the cable car. It safely and quickly transports you to Petřín. The way from here cannot be easier.

### Virgin Mary under Chain / Kostel Panny Marie pod řetězem

The Church of the Virgin Mary Under Chain was founded between 1158 and 1169 by the second Czech King Vladislav II, after his return from the second crusade preparing and donated it to the knightly order of the Johannites (nowadays the Knights of Malta) along with other lands along the river. The church is a part of the huge order of the complex in Prague and was
literally a fortress in the Middle Ages. Even today, the pair of Romanesque towers and the entire facade resemble the original fighting aspect of the Order. The Johanites were a very strong Christian knighthood in the Middle Ages. They were founded in Jerusalem with the task of accompanying pilgrims to the grave of God, but they soon formed the core of the Christian
army and participated in a series of battles against Muslims. Only the Order of the Templars and the Order of the German Knights could equal their strength. The Order of the Johanites was later renamed the Knights of Malta, and still functions mainly as a hospital. In Prague it is one of the six grand large priories and enjoys special prestige, because it is one of the
oldest and with constant continuity. 

The Church of Our Lady itself Under Chain has Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque elements. It was rebuilt several times and burned several times. To this day the building boasts two 32-meter-high prismatic towers that support the massive corner pillars. The other things you see are large part of the work of early Baroque builder Carl Lurago. Interesting is the
name of the church - Under Chain. Allegedly every night there stretched a chain from this location across the Vltava River to the Old Town to prevent the passage of ships that did not pay the toll and the gate of the commandry was also closed. Inside the church you can see the gems of Bohemian Baroque painting. On the main altar there is the Battle of Lepanto and
a Johanite praying to the Virgin Mary. At Lepanto, the Johanites led their last big battle and overcame the Ottoman Empire. The Order was conferred knighthood in front of the painting. The artist is Karel Škréta. From him also comes the picture of St. Barbora on the side altar. Historically it is also interesting that here in 1378 the body of the late Emperor Charles IV was exhibited and in the time of the reign of his son Wenceslas IV there was the arrest at the peace meeting with the King of St. Jan Nepomuk, then general vicar of the Archbishop of Prague. He died as a result of torture, and the same day his dead body was thrown from Charles Bridge into the Vltava River.
