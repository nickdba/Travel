## The Rudolfinum / Rudolfinum

The Rudolfinum was constructed between 1876 – 1881. The contemporary Jan Palach Square was determined to be the right place for that exceptional building. The construction was performed
under direction of architects Josef Zítek and Josef Schulz. They created a unique neorenaissance building that due to its opulence and grandiosity could not be used for any other but representative purposes. In honour of the successor of the Habsbourg throne, Archduke Rudolf, the building was called the Rudolfinum. The Rudolfinum was mainly used for important cultural events, concerts and exhibitions. There are nearly one thousand rooms behind the walls of the Rudolfinum.

Richly decorated exhibition spaces are accompanied by representative chambers. However, let´s peep into the most prestigious part of the Rudolfinum. It is the so-called Dvořákova síň (Dvo-řák Hall) which due to its gorgeous decorations and perfect acoustics became the scene of the most important concerts and social events. They are performed either at Suk or Kubelík Hall. At present the building is a residence of the Czech Philharmonic and the Rudolfinum Gallery.

## Manes Bridge / Mánesův most

And now we are heading to the second Vltava bank over the Mánes Bridge. This one hundred and eightysix foot and sixteen meter wide bridge opened in 1914. Until then, the people of Prague only used a footbridge. The bridge was named after the famous Czech painter Josef Mánes, whom we consider to be the founder of 19th century Czech national painting. Mánes was an   excellent portraitist, landscaper and illustrator. You have already seen his work on Old Town Square in the Orloj, for which he created the Prague Astronomical Clock with scenes of rural life.

From the Mánes Bridge you can also see a large section of old Prague on the opposite left bank of the Vltava River. From the most interesting places you can see Prague Castle with the  St. Vitus Cathedral, on the right side of the bridge the building of the Strako Academy, today’s Office of the Government. On the left side Hergetova Cihelna, a former tannery, Vojanovy Meadows, nowadays a landscaped garden suitable for rest. The famous Charles Bridge, after which we will return on our route to the right bank of Vltava and a forested hill, reminiscent of a table top mountain - Petřín with its lookout tower, a replica of the Paris Eiffel Tower and a beautiful view of Prague 

## Trivia 1

Do you know from what royal dynasty was the Roman Emperor and the Czech King Charles IV? (1310 – 1378)?
a) The Přemyslids  
b) Luxembourg  
c) Habsburgs  

## Straka Academy / Strakova akademie

From the Manes Bridge you can see Straka Academy on the right.
The academy building grew in these quarters between 1891 – 1896. Originally, the building was used as a student´s hostel, especiallyfor poor sons of Bohemian noble families. The design
of the building was the work of a significant architect Václav Roštlapil. A complex of buildings with the total area of 4000 square metres with a garden with another 17 000 square metres grew within 5 years in there. Should we just after the finishing of the works look inside we could see the study rooms, administrative offices of the academy, further the reception room and the cabinets with large collections of learning utilities in the ground floor. The two top floors were reserved for students. The study rooms, dormitories and a domestic chapel could be found there. Surprisingly, there was even central heating in the building and the students could use a spa with a swimming pool, the premises also involved both summer and winter gyms and a fencing room, too. You could even find a hospital in the premises, too. After the Academy operated for two years a CzechGerman Gymnasium was founded here, too. In the period of WW1 the Academy fell under the organization of the Red Cross. The Red Cross founded a hospital in the premises with the capacity of 470 beds. The main assembly hall of the Straka Academy turned into a giant operating theatre and the higher floors were occupied by patients instead of students. The hospital was cancelled in 1918. The independent Czechoslovakia was founded at that time and the new republic used the premises of the academy for offices and state needs. 
The building turned into the residence of the protectorate government after the formation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After WW2 the building served for the purposes of the government again. The Czech Government Office has been residing in the building of the Academy since 1993.

## Kafka Museum

The Franz Kafka Museum (Czech: Muzeum Franze Kafky) in Prague is dedicated to the author Franz Kafka. The museum hosts a number of first edition Kafka books.

The exhibition features copies of manuscripts as well as photographs and personal documents, but no originals. It includes correspondence between Kafka and writer Milena Jesenská. Some of the explanatory texts are hardly readable, because they are located on transparent surfaces with exhibits in the same color as the letters. All texts are in English, some - mainly quotations - also in Czech and German. The impression therefore is that the museum is made mainly for foreign tourists rather than people from the Czech Republic. There are two permanent exhibitions: one explores Prague's influence on Kafka's work, and the other focuses on how Kafka describes Prague in his writing.

The museum features strange and absurd design elements that are inspired by Franz Kafka's unusual ideas. The space is dark and has special elements such as a long, red-lit staircase and mysterious sound effects. Outside the museum is an exhibit called Piss, a bronze fountain of two men urinating into a lake shaped like the Czech Republic. It was created by Czech sculptor David Černý in 2004.

## Lennon’s Wall

When you continue along our route, you will go next to a place famous for most visitors - around the “Lennon’s Wall”. This brightly painted wall has become a reminder of the tragic end of John Lennon at the beginning of the 1980s. The wall with a portrait of a legendary artist soon became a place where people expressed their views and protests against the communist regime. Even at the cost of police repression. And this tradition continues now.


## Trivia 2

Do you remember from which Prague bridge St. John of Nepomuk was dropped into the Vltava?  
a) From the Main Bridge  
b) From the Czech Bridge  
c) From Charles Bridge  

## Kampa Island / Kampa

Kampa Island is one of the most idyllic and tranquil places in the Czech capital. The island is divided into two visibly distinct parts. The section nearest to Charles Bridge is formed by a small, cosy square; the second is a park, formed when several historical gardens were joined together. Kampa was first mentioned in the late 12th century, when the island was given over to the Johannine Monastery. For centuries the island was a victim of regular flooding, thanks to which its shape was in constant flux. This situation changed after the fire of 1541
when Kampa was shorn up with rubble from the burntout buildings. Kampa is divided from the Mala Strana by a channel of the Vltava known as the Čertovka. It is said the name (which comes from the Czech word for ‘demon’) comes from a woman who owned a mill there. As she was so successful, and unusually for the time ran the mill herself, people began to think that she was in league with the Devil.

Until the mid 16th century the island was practically deserted except for three watermills. Today visitors can still see two mill wheels. In the 16th century the island was settled by craftsmen responsible for the upkeep of Charles Bridge.

You can take a break at the Mlýnská kavárna (coffeshop)

## Museum Kampa

Museum Kampa is a modern art gallery in Prague, Czech Republic, showing Central European, and in particular Czech work. The pieces are from the private collection of Meda Mládek, wife of Jan V. Mládek. The museum opened in 2003 and is housed in the Sova's Mills on the eastern bank of the Kampa Island on the River Vltava.

There is a large sculpture of a chair by Magdalena Jetelová outside the museum, which is a prominent landmark visible from across the Vltava.

## Charles Bridge

### Lesser Town Bridge Towers / Malostranské mostecké věže mark 

The Lesser Town Bridge Towers end of Charles Bridge on the Lesser Town side. These two towers, unlike the tower on the Old Town side, were never decorated. The smaller of the two has survived from the days of Judith Bridge, when it was part of the defence system. It got its Renaissance overcoat in the 16th century. Rare Romanesque reliefs have survived on the walls depicting a ruler on the throne and a figure on his knees. The larger tower was built in 1464 during the reign of King George of Poděbrady. On this tower there are symbols relating to the reign of Wenceslasa IV, as it was originally intended to mimic the Old Town Bridge Tower, the proof of which are the empty recesses on the facade. An interesting fact about the tower is that on the battlements there is one empty space where a stone is missing. According to chroniclers, the stone fell out when ravens sat on it. The stone landed on the head of King Wenceslasa’s favourite knight when he was returning to Prague after a battle. The knight is said to have been valiant and courageous, and had been through many battles without a scratch. Now he had died from a stone dislodged by ravens hitting him on the head. In his memory the king never had the stone replaced.

### Charles Bridge

See the statue map.
Charles Bridge replaced Judith Bridge which had spanned the Vltava since the late 12th century. Judith Bridge was the longest in central Europe (514m long) 
until it was swept away in a flood in 1342. It was Charles IV’s idea to build a new bridge (originally called simply the Stone Bridge). The first stone was laid in 1357. Charles IV. was concerned whether the new bridge would be built properly so that it dd not meet the same fate as its predecessor. He therefore ordered raw eggs to be mixed into the mortar to make it
stronger. A study has shown that Petr Parleř, the builder of the bridge, did indeed add raw eggs as well as wine to the mortar! The striking feature of the bridge, 520m span and 95m wide roadway is the gallery of 30 mostly baroque statues which date from the 17th, and to a lesser extent, the 19th century, by leading artists of the day (F. M. Brokoff, M. B. Braun, M. V. Jaeckl for example). The oldest statue is the bronze knight called Bruncvik with a lion that stands on a plinth on Kampa Island. The second oldest is the statue of the Holy Cross on the third pillar as one heads from the Old Town Bridge Tower). A Hebrew inscription celebrating the Almighty is draped around the cross. On the penultimate pillar on the right stands the famous Turk guarding a cave where Christi ans have been imprisoned. This is part of a group of statues representing St. John of Matha, St. Felix of Valois and St. Ivan. Another well known statue is that of St. John of Nepomuk, and about halfway along the bridge is a relief showing this saint being cast from the bridge. The last statue representing St. Cyril and Methodius was only installed here in 1938. In the Middle Ages jousting tournaments used to take place on Charles Bridge. Dishonest bakers would be dunked into the icy waters of the Vltava in a special cage from one of the ledges on the bridge.

### Old Town Bridge Tower / Staroměstská mostecká věž 

The old town bridge tower is regarded as one of the most attractive medieval towers in the city. On one side it borders on Křižovnicke Square and forms the gateway to Charles Bridge.
The tower was begun during the reign of Charles IV.and formed a part of the Old Town’s defence’s. The tower’s creator was the celebrated Prague architect,who also worked on the Cathedral of St Vitus at Prague Caste, Petr Parleř. The Old Town Bridge Tower is decorated with many pieces of sculpture. On the east side we see rulers Charles IV. on the right and Wenceslas IV on the left, during whose reigns the tower was built. Between them stand the patron saints of the Czech lands, St. Vit and above him St. Zikmund and St. Vojtěch. On the side of the tower Petr Parléř had the Latin inscription made which reads: SIGNA-TESIGNATEMERE METANGISETANGIS („Be told, be told and watch out; he who touches me, dies“). The inscription is a palindrome in Latin. The importance in the Middle Ages, and in particular the reign of Charles IV., of symbolism is indicated by the moment when the foundation stone for the tower was laid: year 1357, 9th July, at 5:31 (135797531, another palindrome). In the same vein, the tower is divided into four ‘spheres’. The first is the Earth and the second the Moon decorated with 28 crabs (28 day cycle of the moon). Above the Moon is the Sun’s sphere (symbolising royal and imperial might), and the fourth is the celestial sphere, symbolised by statues of the saints.
The tower also features symbols of the lands belonging to the Czech Crown. The western side of the tower is much plainer. Facing the length of the bridge is it was open to attacks (for instance in 1648, when the Swedes laid siege to Prague – these events are commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the tower dating back to 1650). The tower was for a while used as
a prison for debtors and to this day one can still see grafitti scribbled by prisoners on the walls inside. The steps up into the tower ascend to floors from which there are stunning views of the bridge and Hradčany.

###  Krizovnicke Square / Křižovnické náměstí

As soon as you pass under the Old Town Bridge Tower you will reach the small Knights of the Cross Square. On the left side of the square you can see the Church of St. Francis of Assisi, before you the facade of the Church of the Most Holy Savior belonging to the large complex of Clementium and you will surely not miss the statue of Charles IV. Church of St. Francis of Assisi / Kostel sv. Františka z Assisi is closely connected with the only originally Czech Christian order of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, established by St. Agnes, the abbess of the Convent of Agnes, already described as a hospital brotherhood. The Order was recognized by Pope Gregory IX as early as 1237 and its sign is a red cross with a six-pointed star. And because they were purely hospital order, they settled in the same way as the Johanites on the other Vltava bank by the river. In the hospital, it was always very important to have plenty of clean water and the church of St. Francis was truly connected with an important hospital. It probably saved it from burning at the time of the Hussites. The church and the hospital were the most damaged in 1648 in battles against the Swedes. From the monastery windows at that time, they shot at the attacking Swedes, trying not to let them pass over Charles Bridge to the Old Town. This eventually succeeded, the Knights of the Cross losing their master at the time, hit by bullets, but the Swedes left Prague, though with a large part of the valuable treasures from Prague Castle and the Lesser Town Churches. 

The Order grew further, in the 16th and 17th centuries, even the masters of the order and the Archbishops of Prague, and at that time, the Order of the Knights of the Cross repaired
the Church of St. Francis in the form you see today. The construction plans were drafted by Frenchman Jean Baptiste Mathey around 1679. The dominant feature of the church is a massive, forty meter high, brick dome. Along the sides of the entrance you can see the statues of the Madonna and St. Jan Nepomuk; on the facade there are statues of Czech patrons. In the interior the church has a cross on the ground plan and is oriented by the main altar to the north, which is unusual. On the ceiling you will find a fresco of the Last Judgment by Václav Vavřinec Reiner. The church was renowned for its excellent music, and the local masses were among the biggest musical events of Prague. You can also see one of the most beautiful organs in Prague, played by a young Antonin Dvořák. Vine Column / Viniční sloup. Just close to the corner of the church you can see the statues of St. Wenceslas on a stone, grapevine-wrapped
column. This is so-called Vine Column that indicated the place for collecting tax on the common grape vine the opposite building. Around the column you can see the oldest Prague paving from the 12th century. 

Statue of the King Charles IV / Socha Karla IV. The bronze statue of the King and Emperor Charles IV also stands on the square. It was built here in 1848 to
mark the 500th anniversary of the founding of Charles University. King and Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378) was the most important Czech king and one of the most powerful sovereigns of medieval Europe. In 1355 he became the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He was educated, and after his father, John of Luxembourg, one of the greatest European knights, inheriting a warlike nature. He spoke five languages​​ fluently and used his power to consolidate the Czech state, which has since been known as the Crown of the Czech Lands. He was also the author of the most important imperial constitutional law of the Golden Bull of Charles, which was valid until the demise of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Prague was chosen as the capital city of the empire and it grew under its rule. The traces of its builder’s effort are all over the city. He founded the University, built churches, bridges over the Vltava, the cathedral, built Prague Castle and the entire New Town of Prague. The Czechs today call him the Father of the Homeland to this day.

## Trivia 3

Do you know what the Queen, the wife of Wenceslas IV was called , who regularly attended the sermons of Master Jan Hus?  
a) Kunhuta  
b) Markéta  
c) Žofie  

## Clementinum(Klementinum)

The Clementinum, a former Jesuit college, is the second largest place of interest in Prague after Prague Castle, and the largest Jesuit building in the Czech lands. The Jesuits arrived in Prague in 1556 on the invitation of Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I in order to strengthen the Counter- Reformation in the Czech lands. For more than 200 years they built up their college, a complex of buildings between four streets and two squares and divided by five courtyards. Architects such as Carlo Lugaro, Francesco Caratti, Domenico Orsi and František Maxmilian Kaňka worked on the Clementinum. The statues adorning the buildings are the work of Jan Jiři Bendl – the statues of the saints on the fasade of the Church of the Holy Saviour are by Giovanni Bartolomeo Cometi. Other interesting features at the Clementinum are the thirteen sundials on the walls of the various buildings and the tower of the ob-servatory from 1751, from which the noon gun used to be fired. During their time in the Czech lands and at the Klementinum, the Jesuits devoted much of their effort to education. They built all kinds of schools and in 1571 they were granted permission by the pope to award academic titles. Many future Czech scholars, who would have a significant bearing on the history of the country, studied at schools and colleges in the Klementinum. The Jesuit Order also had its darker side such as witch trials and book burning. In 1773 the Jesuit Order was abolished by Pope Clement XIV and the monks were forced to leave the Klementinum. In the third courtyard of the complex rises the observatory tower with the metal statue of Atlantis on the top. For more than 200 years (since 1775) a meteorological observatory has been in constant operation here, recording the weather in Prague, longer than anywhere else in Europe. The entrance to the Mirrored Chapel, now used as a concert hall, can be found in the fourth courtyard. Most of its halls are decorated with rich stucco work or paintings. At present, the Clementinum is home to the National Library and many valuable collections of books can be found here.
