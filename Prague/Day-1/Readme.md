## Prague Historic centre

### Trivia 1
Do you know what Prague is also called?  
a) The City of 100 spires  
b) The City on seven hills  
c) The City of lights  

The historic center of Prague with its atmosphere of medieval streets is reminiscent of old trade
routes, exquisite royal processions, knight tournaments and Hussite wars. Since 1992, it has been
included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Nowhere else will you find such a concentration of
historical landmarks and places where you can breathe in the history and romance of a time
gone by. There are few places where you can stop and rest in such beautiful landscaped gardens
and parks, and few places where you can walk along the same roads as the builder Petr Parléř
or the astronomers Tycho de Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart experienced
his greatest life achievements here. Franz Kafka wrote his most beautiful novels, and Rabbi Löw
created an artificial man called a Golem from clay.

Prague is historically divided into 4 parts, formerly separate cities, which differed not only in
their location but mainly in their population and position.

## Celetná Street / Celetná Ulice:

During the reign of one of the most prominent Czech and European rulers, Emperor Charles IV,
the importance of Celetna Street grew when it became part of the socalled Royal Way. The Royal
Powder Tower Way was a route through the city which Czech kings had to follow on the day of their coronation.
It leads from Vyšehrad – Prague’s second castle along Celetna Street, over the Old Town Square, along Karlova 
Street and across Charles Bridge up to Prague Castle, where the coronation would take place in the Cathedral of St Vitus.

The name of the Street is probably derived from the word Calty – a type of bread baked here in
the Middle Ages. Celetna Street is full of interesting and historically valuable buildings whose
foundations go back to the Gothic period. These structures then underwent Renaissance and then
mostly baroque reconstruction. Celetna Street is regarded as one of the highlights of Prague’s
architectural treasure trove. Some of its most noteworthy buildings are the House at the Black
Madonna, the Pachta Palace and the House of the Golden Angel.

### Municipal House / Obecní dům

Now you can see one of the most important buildings of Czech statehood. It was here that
an independent Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed on 28 October 1918. This was a ma-
jor event in modern Czech history, following on the reorganization of Europe after World War I
and the dividing of Austria-Hungary. The Municipal Building is a wonderful example
of Prague Art Nouveau. It was built by the Prague Municipality in 1905-1912. The aim was to
support the Czech social life and a feeling of Czech nationality, and thus create a counterpart
to the nearby German Building, where the German-speaking inhabitants of Prague met. Czech
and German-speaking populations led to long-standing national conflicts that often culminated 
in street battles in these places.

The Municipal Building was constructed as a representative building, both architecturally and
technically. You would find in them state-of-the-art equipment, unprecedented in Central Europe. 
For example, 28 electric and hydraulic lifts, air-conditioning with remote control, central vacuum 
cleaner and the largest electric organ in Austria-Hungary. For the first time there
was also the peak of progress - linoleum. Even the decoration of the Municipal Building
was magnificent. The most visible is the mosaic above the facade by Karel Špinar, called Hold
Prague and the Ladislav Šaloun sculpture The Humiliation and Resurrection of the Nation. 

You will find many other artistic representations of Czech history and art from the most important
Czech artists of the time e.g. Alfons Mucha, Mikoláš Aleš or J.V. Myslbek. And all this in the ex-
terior as well as in the incredible 1240 rooms within the Municipal Building. One of them
is the main Prague concert hall - the Smetana Hall. Here you can see the concerts of the
Prague Spring International Music Festival, held regularly since 1946.

### Trivia 2

Do you know why the gates are called Powder Gates?  
a) There was so much dust during the coronation processions, that almost covered the gate.  
b) They served as a storage for gunpowder.  
c) Alfréd Prach built it and his surname translate as dust.  

### Powder Tower / Prašná brána

The Powder Tower is one of the original 13 city gates in Old Town, Prague. Its construction began in 1475 
with the foundation stone placed by Vladislav II. It replaced the Přemyslid dynasty era gate in 1475 which
was a defensive tower. The new tower was intended to be an attractive entrance into the city and was built 
in the Gothic style by Matěj Rejsek as a gift from the Old Town to King Vladislav Jagiello.

Originally called the ‘Horska’ gate it acquired the name ‘Powder’ in the 17th century, when it was used
to store gunpowder (‘prašna’ coming from the word ‘prach meaning powder).
The appearance of the tower today dates back to 1875 - 76, when it was given a neo-Gothic makeover
by architect Josef Mocker. Sculptures representing the Czech kings adorn the tower – on the eastern side we find Přemysl
Otakar II and Charles IV and on the western side George of Poděbrady and Vladislav Jagiello.

### The Black Madonna House

The House at the Black Madonna is situated at the corner of Celetna Street and Ovocny trh. It
was built in 1911 – 1912 by architect Josef Gočar in the cubist style. With some exceptions, cubist
architecture is specific to the Czech lands and this building is one of the best examples.

Cubism uses geometrical shapes in its architecture. This comes from the architect’s conviction that
the basic geometrical form is the cube. The House at the Black Madonna was originally a multifunctional 
building with shops on the ground floor and offices, flats and the famous Orient coffee house with its 
cubist furniture on the floors above. At present the building is a national monument and houses a collection 
of Czech cubist paintings, furniture, sculpture and architects’ plans.
The name of the building comes from the Black Madonna house symbol on the corner, kept behind gold Renaissance bars.

## Basilica of ST. James / Kostel svatého Jakuba Většího

The Basilica of St James was originally a part of the Minorite Monastery and dates from the 13th century. 
In 1311 a feast to mark the coronation of King John of Luxemburg and Eliška of the Přemyslids was held here. 
After a fire in 1366 it was rebuilt in the Gothic style, but burnt down again in 1596 when it was hit by a lightning. 
Only at the end of the 17th century after yet another fire did it acquire its current baroque appearance. The basilica 
has excellent acoustics and concerts often take place here. The basilica also boasts a tremendous baroque organ from 1702. 
The creator of the stucco decoration on the church fasade is the Italan Ottavio Mosto. Above the main entrance visitors can see 
St Jacob in traditional pilgrim’s attire holding a stick.

There are 21 altars in the church made by such master craftsmen as Heinsch, Brandl and Reiner, whose painting called 
The Martyrdom of St James adorns the main altar. After the Cathedral of St Vitus, the Basilica of St James is the longest
church in Prague. In the left nave the baroque tomb of the Czech chancellor Vratislav of Mitrovice attracts most attention. 
It was designed by Jan Bernard Fischer of Erlach and decorated with sculptures by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff. It is regarded 
as the most attractive tomb in the Czech lands. Underneath the tomb is a crypt containing the tombs of the Earls of Mitrovice.
There is a well known legend associated with the tomb – the earl was buried alive by mistake and Basilica of St. James four 
years later, when the tomb was opened, his body was found in the sitting position trying in vain to lift the top off the tomb. 
In reality he died and was buried in Vienna.

On the main altar can see wooden statue of the Virgin Mary, a priceless piece from the 15th century. As legend would have it, 
this statue was always considered to have miraculous powers and people brought it all kinds of valuable gifts, even gold.

## Ungelt – Tyn Courtyard / Ungelt – Týnský dvur

A walled courtyard housing a customs post for merchants entering the Old Town was situated
here as early as the 12th century. Every merchant had to submit his goods and pay duty (um Geld – Geld is German for
Money, hence the name). In return the ruler would guarantee his safety. Customs duty was paid here until the end of 
the 16th century.

The original shape of the courtyard with two gates either end has remained. Around the Ungelt a hospital and church for 
the merchants were built and in 1135 a pharmacy was added, the oldest in Prague. In houses near the two gates to the courtyard 
one can still find remains of Romanesque houses in the cellars (at the turn of the 13th century, when Prague was experiencing huge 
problems with flooding, the whole of the Old Town was raised by 3.5 - 4m, meaning the ground floor of the buildings we see today 
would have been the first floor of Romanesque era structures). 

In the enclosed courtyard stands the Granovsky House, one of the best preserved Renaissance buildings in Prague. 
The loggia of the wing we can see from the courtyard is decorated with religious and mythical motifs.

## Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí)

Alongside Prague Castle the Old Town Square is the most important place in Prague. Its long history goes back to the 11th century 
when the square formed the crossroads of several longdistance trade routes and served as a marketplace. It was known across the 
whole of Europe at that time. Celebrations, jousting tournaments and executions took place there.

In 1321 King John of Luxemburg held a jousting tournament in the square, which he took part in himself. He was badly injured and 
for a long time his life hung in the balance. One of the most wretched events to take place in the square happened in 1621, 
at the beginning of the Thirty Years War, which affected the whole of Europe. 

27 Czech nobles, knights and burghers, leaders of an antiHabsburg revolt, were executed. The events of that day are commemorated 
by a plaque on the eastern side of the Old Town Hall. 27 crosses formed by cobblestones near the town hall mark the site where the 
executions took place. It is said that Emperor Ferdinand II, who had the rebellious Czechs decapitated, ordered drums to be beaten 
loudly during the execution so as not to hear the defiant cries  of the condemned. For instance Prokop Dvořicky of Olbramovice, 
before he went to his death, cried: „Tell the emperor that I now stand before his unjust court, but he will face a terrible and just one“. 

In 1945, as World War II was drawing to a close, fighting took place here during the Prague Uprising and the Old Town Hall was 
severely damaged. The Old Town Square is a national monument. The remains of some very old buildings have survived in the square. 
Even here the original ground level used to be 2 - 3m lower. This means that some of the present-day houses sit on the remains 
of Romanesque cellars. Many of these now house restaurants and winebars, a visit to which provides the opportunity to see these
medieval spaces. 

The houses in the Old Town Square are like a textbook of almost all architectural styles going. 
You’ll find Gothic, Renaissance and baroque elements, and on the south side of the square you’ll discover houses which still occupy
their medieval plots of land, evident from their narrow facades. Some of the most fascinating buildings on the square are the 
Kinsky Palace, The House at the Stone Bell, The Tyn School and the Štorch’s House. The names of houses here and throughout the 
medieval parts of the city are very often derived from a house symbol which can be found on the facade.

The most important buildings on the square: 
Golz-Kinsky Palace / Palác Golz Kinských, which visibly leads into the area of ​​the square, was built Old Town Sguare, 
Týn Temple was born here in 1843. In the 19th century, there was also a German grammar school, which was
attended by the world-famous writer Franz Kafka. The National Gallery is today located in the palace.

### Trivia 3

If you look near the monument of Master Jan Hus toward the ground, you will see
that the pavement is intersected by a mysterious line, ending with a gold plate.
What does it mean and what did it serve?  
a) The site of the Old Town gallows  
b) The meridian to which Prague time ran in the past  
c) The place where the plague column stood  

### Church of Our Lady before Týn / Týnský chrám

The Gothic Church of the Virgin Mary before Týn with its 80m high twin towers, of which the southernmost is noticeably thicker 
than the other, competes with the tower of the Old Town Hall across the square. The church was began in the 14th century
on the site of an original Romanesque chapel dating back to the 12th century, and it served as the church for foreign merchants
staying at the Ungelt.

During the Hussite wars the Tyn Church was the main place of worship for the Old Town and played an important role in the Hussite cause.
From 1427 Jan Rokycana, later elected as Hussite archbishop, served as a priest there. According to legend, in 1437 the timber meant for
the construction of the roof of the main Hussite church in Prague was used to build the gallows for the Hussite leader Jan Roháč z Dubé. 
20 years later the timber used to build the roof was to have been used for the stage at the wedding of King Ladislav Pohrobek. The young 
regent died just before his wedding day. 

The interior decoration of the Church dates chiefly from the 15th century. Visitors will find a Gothic stone pulpit, a Gothic tin font, 
statues of St John and the Virgin Mary and the statue of the Týn Madonna with Child, hich dates back to around 1420. The most beautiful 
stonework in the church is considered to be the canopy above the tomb of bishop Lucián of Mirandola by Matěj Rejsek (builder of the Powder Tower) 
from the end of the 15th century. We can also find statues by Jan Jiří Bendl and paintings by artists such as Škréta – the main altar of 
the Ascension of the Virgin Mary, the altar of St Barbora on the right and the Annunciation, St Vojtěch a St Joseph are all his works. 
In the south nave and on the altar of St Anne we find paintings by Brandl and on the third pillar in the church there is a carved Renaissance 
altar from around 1600.

One of the most celebrated works of art in theChurch is the tomb with a portrait of Tycho de Brahe, the world famous astronomist and 
astrologist who worked at the famous court of Rudolf II.
 
### House at the Stone Bell / Dům u kamenného zvonu

House at the Stone Bell / Dům U kamenného zvonu, on the south side of the square is perhaps the most attractive building in the Old Town
Square. It was probably the property of Queen Eliška of the Přemyslids, the wife of King John of Luxemburg and it was originally a 
Romanesque structure, proof of which are the 12th-century walls in the cellars.
In the early 14th century the house was transformed into a splendid Gothic Palace with two floors, Gothic halls and two chapels. 
Frescoes from the early 14th century have survived to this day, and in the parts of the ground floor accessible to the public the remains 
of the original carved stone decoration can be seen featu-ring a king and a queen on the throne and two armed figures Golz-Kinsky Palace
and House at the Stone Bell
The house gets its name from the obvious house symbol, a stone bell which protrudes out into the square from the corner of the building.
Today this is a replica of the bell. It’s generally thought that the bell serves as a reminder of the events of 1310, when Queen Eliška 
of the Přemyslid’s chaplain gave a signal to the army of King John of Luxemburg and his followers in the town to open the gates, avoiding 
the taking of the Old Town by force. In 1333 Charles IV stayed in the house when he found Prague Castle completely deserted and abandoned 
on his return to Prague from France and Italy.

### House of the White Unicorn / Dům u bílého jedno-rožce. 

This house is rebuilt in the Gothic and Renaissance style, and in the late 18th century it acquired a late Baroque façade. Beneath the 
corner of the house there is a Romanesque room from the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. Josefina Dušková was born here, the well-known 
girlfriend of music composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

### House of Štorch / Štorchův dům. 

The house is known for its painted facade, dating from 1896-1897. The paintings on the facade were created according to the cartouche of 
the prominent Czech painter Mikoláš Aleš. The dominant feature of the painting is the equestrian figure of St. Wenceslas. He sits on a 
white horse and holds a banner in his hand. St. Wenceslas is one of the patrons of the Czech nation and acts as its protector. 

The ornamental plant under the hooves of the horse complements the signs of the St. Wenceslas eagle and the Czech lion. 
A bird circles above a tree a symbol of the freedom of the Czech nation, and the lizard, which represents the enemies of state autonomy,
attempting to climb out in vain.

### Trivia 4

The Turk of Prague is one of the most famous spirits of the Old Town. Do you know what crime he committed and why he must haunt?  
a) He killed the royal armorer  
b) He scoffed at the priest from the nearby Tyn Church  
c) Killed the daughter of the innkeeper to whom he was betrothed and who, during his stay in Turkey, married someone else  

### Jan Hus Monument (Pomník mistra Jana Husa)

The memorial of Master Jan Hus commemorates the significant Czech religious reformer. It stands on the northern side of the Old Town Square.
This sculpture by sculptor Ladislav Šaloun from 1915 represents two groups of people - the first are the Hussite fighters, the second 
the Protestants, forced into exile for about 200 years. 
A sloping line of evenly laid paving blocks can be seen near the memorial. It shows where the Prague meridian (14° 30' longitude) passes.

Master Jan Hus (1371 – 1415) A prominent Czech religious reformer who criticised the Church at a time when Europe was heading into religious 
turmoil due to the papal schism. Hus was born in the small village of Husinec in South Bohemia, graduated from the Theological 
Faculty of Prague University, and later became its rector. At the time he was one of the greatest thinkers in Europe. He preached in the 
Bethlehem Chapel about putting right problems which had developed in the Church, and about returning the Church to its original beliefs 
such as modesty and recognising the bible as the single religious text. He criticised corruption in the Church, rife at the time, 
and wrote many works on reforming the Church which later formed the basis for the reform movement in Germany under Martin Luther.
Hus soon brought the wrath of the pope in Rome upon himself, and was excommunicated. Even though for a long time he was under direct 
protection of King Wenceslas IV., who also had his grievances with the state of the Church, he was forced to leave Prague in 1412. 
In 1414 he was invited to appear before the church Church Council in Constance, where he would be given the opportunity to defend his thoughts. 
But Hus’s fate was decided by the council long before he arrived and he was declared a heretic in 1415 and burnt at the stake.

### Old Town Hall (Staroměstská radnice)

The Old Town Hall was founded in 1338. It is comprised of 5 individual houses which were gradually joined together into one building. 
The dominating feature of the Old Town Hall is its 69.5m high tower dating from the late 14th century, with an ornate oriel window, part of the
chapel, on the eastern side. On the southern side of the tower we find the famous Astronomical Clock, created by Mikulaš of Kadaně in 1410.
According to the legend, when the Astronomical Clock was finished, the councillors had Mikulaš of Kadaně’s eyes put out so that he couldn’t 
repeat the feat in another city. 

The Astronomical Clock can be divided into three sections: The first section contains the small windows, at which every hour the 12 apostles 
appear and bow to the waiting crowds. Every apostle holds his symbol: St Peter has a key, St Matthew an axe, St John a chalice and so on. 
Four figures directly underneath also spring into action when the apostles appear. The skeleton inverts his hourglass and rings a bell to 
let us know that our lives are at an end; the Turk, a symbol of a comfortable life, nods his head but then shakes it refusing death. 
The figure representing Vanity looks in the mirror and the Miser shakes his purse full of money. At the end of the show the cockerel 
crows marking the beginning of another hour of this life The second section is called the upper face and shows the movement of the planets. 
Naturally, this represents an old way of thinking with the planets and the Sun circling a stationary Earth. At the very bottom is the 
calendarwheel, where in addition to the coat of arms of the Old Town, the signs of the zodiac and the months of the year represented by motifs
from rural life are depicted. Around the edge of the wheel are 365 notches; the wheel turns one notch each day taking a whole year to make one 
full turn. 

The Astronomical Clock also shows four times: Central European time shown with Roman numerals around the edge of the upper face; Old Bohemian time 
is shown with gold Gothic  numbers (according to this method of time keeping, the day begins at sunset); Babylonian time where the hours are much
longer in the summer than in winter; and celestial time shown by a small star on a rod extending from the zodiacal cross. The 2nd floor interiors
of the town hall are of particular historical interest. Here the original Gothic council chamber has survived. The large chamber is decorated
with pictures by Vaclav Brožik. In the late Gothic Jiřik’s Chamber visitors will find the remnants of murals from the end of the 15th century. 

Just like every medieval town hall, the Old Town Hall used to have a prison. Prisoners were lowered down into their own private cell, a hole in the
ground which was then filled in with stone. Prisoners were, in essence, buried alive.

### Church of St Nicholas (Kostel sv. Mikuláše)

The Church of St Nicholas was originally a Gothic building and served as the parish church of the Old Town before the Tyn Church was built. 
Following the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620, and during the Counter Reformation in the Czech lands, the church was taken over by Benedictine monks.

In1732 - 1735 it was then rebuilt in the baroque style by Kilian Ignac Dienzenhofer. The entrance to the church faced the Jewish Town and so did
not have to be particularly decorative. The side of the church faces the Old Town Hall. For this reason the side of the building is richly decorated, 
creating the impression that this is the main entrance. The decoration on the side was designed to be looked at from close up, evident from the way 
the statues (created by Antonin Braun) are leaning over. The interior of the church is full of intricate stucco work by Bernardo Spinetti. Petr Assamo 
painted the pictures which adorn the dome, the presbytery and the side chapels. These paintings show scenes from the life of St Nicholas and St Benedict. 

It is hard not to notice the huge crownshaped chandelier, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II. In 1787 as part of Emperor Josef II’s religious reforms, almost 
all the monasteries and many churches that did not provide a service for the community, were closed.
The Church of St Nicholas was not spared and after the closure was used by the military. During a later war, the then commader of the Prague garrison 
had the decoration in the church restored by artsist who otherwise would have been sent to the front. After the creation of Pařižska Street the eastern
corner of the church was completed and in 1906 a recess holding a statue of St Nicholas and a neoclassical fountain with dolphins were added.
After World War I the church was once again used for its original purpose by the Hussite Church. 

### Franz Kafka (1883 – 1924)

The building joined on to the church in Kafka Square stands on the site of the former Benedictine Monastery. The house bears a plaque reminding us that 
this is the birthplace of the famous Czech author (who of course wrote in German), Franz Kafka.

Franz Kafka is one of the most widely known and ce-lebrated writers of the 20th century. He is known above all for his novels The Trial, America and 
The Castle. Kafka came from a Jewish family and grew up at a time when ethnic conflicts began to escalate in Prague, a fact evident in his work. 
As mentioned earlier, Kafka was born in the former Benedictine Monastery next to the Church of St Nicholas and spent most of his life in the
Old Town. Kafka’s family lived, for instance, in the House U minuty, part of the Old Town Hall and in Celetna Street. The young Kafka also attended the
German Grammar School in the Kinsky Palace. In the course of his life in Prague, Kafka became acquainted with the elite of the Prague literary
world such as Franz Werfel, Max Brod and the Kirsch brothers. In 1915 he won his first literary prize for a short story called The Stoker. 
In 1916 – 17 he worked in the Golden Lane at Prague Castle, but had already been diagnosed as having tuberculosis. At the end of his life Kafka 
left Prague and died of tuberculosis in 1924 in Kierling near Vienna.

The House at the Minute is an intricate and historic home originating from the 15th century where Kafka lived from 1889 to 1896.

## Prague Jewish Town / Pražské Židovské město

Prague’s Jewish community has a history going back a very long way indeed. Jewish merchants and money lenders were settling in Prague as early as the
10th century. The original community in the Malá Strana moved in the middle of the 12th century to Josefov. Throughout its existence, the Jewish 
community was confined to clearly marked areas which it could not leave. At the height of its development, 1,900 people were crammed into 93,000m2.

From the outset the Jewish population of Josefov set up its own administration and had its own schools and synagogues. The synagogues were the
most important places in the ghetto. In medieval times they weren’t only places of worship but also places where Jewish teachers met their pupils.
Before the Jewish Town had its own town hall, all public matters were settled in the synagogues too. Over the course of their history the Jews suffered
numerous pogroms. The first is recorded as having happened in 1096 when the first army of crusaders was passing through the city. 

In 1389 another large pogrom took place in the Jewish ghetto, which the young Avigdor Kara, a future Prague Rabbi, experienced at first hand. He wrote
of what he saw in his Selichot remorseful prayers still read today on days of atonement around the world. The status of Prague’s Jews improved slightly
in 1781, when Emperor Josef II issued his socalled ‘Toleration Act’, which gave the Jewish population access to schooling. In 1848 Jews were given the 
same rights as everybody else and for the first time in history they were allowed to move out of the ghetto. These reforms meant that almost all the rich 
Jewish families moved out of the ghetto and poor Czech families moved in. Gradually the ghetto began to deteriorate and become a dangerous, rundown area. 

At the end of the 19th century the situation in the ghetto had become so bad (for instance, rooms in some old houses were divided up into smaller rooms 
with a chalk line or a curtain, and each room was inhabited by a whole family), that the Prague authorities decided to demolish it to prevent the spread 
of illness. Some 300 medieval houses and 20 streets were wiped off the map. After this, only a small part of the original ghetto remained today’s
Jewish Town – Josefov.

Tickets can be bought from the museums of the Pinkas Synagogue, Klausen Synagogue or the Spanish synagogue.

### Trivia 5

Do you know where the Golem of Prague is hiding according to legend?  
a) At the site of the Old Synagogue  
b) In the Old Jewish Cemetery  
c) He is not hiding, but walks regularly through the streets of the Jewish Quarter and catching thieves

### Pinkas Synagogue / Pinkasova synagoga

This synagogue was established by Rabbi Pinkas in the late 15th century as part of a house called U Erbů. The Pinkas Synagogue has been rebuilt
several times as the building was the victim of several floods. During the last archeological digging here, remnants of a medieval ritual bath (a Mikva)
were discovered. Today the interior of the synagogue with its Gothic vaulted ceilings is a monument to the victims of the holocaust. The walls
are covered from floor to ceiling with the names of more than 77 thousand Jews from Bohemia and Moravia, who were murdered by the Nazis.

### Old Jewish Cemetery / Starý židovský hřbitov

The Old Jewish Cemetery, adjacent to the Klaus Synagogue, is called Bethchaim (The House of Life) by the Jews themselves, and it is a place of great 
significance around the world. It is not known exactly when the cemetery was established, but the oldest gravestone found there bears the date April 25, 1439
and belongs to the well known scholar and poet, Avigdor Kara, who described the pogrom of 1389. Burials took place in the cemetery continuously until 1787,
when it was closed. As the Jewish community for centuries had just one cemetery at its disposal, crammed in between the houses, and as Jews were not allowed
to dig up the bones of the dead, they began to bury people one on top of the other in layers. It’s estimated that the cemetery holds 12 thousand gravestones
and 80 thousand graves in 12 layers. The gravestones show the name’s of the deceased as well as many other interesting clues about his or her life.

Many gravestones bear verse’s and emblems symbolising names, occupations and traditional clans. Some of the best known symbols are hands giving a blessing, 
signifying that the deceased belonged to the Aron tribe (Kohen) of priests; the Hebrew name Dob means bear, a kettle is the symbol of the Levi family, a mouse 
signifies the Maisel family and so on. Unlike the majority of Jewish cemeteries, we find reliefs depicting human forms. These are somewhat imperfect, intentionally 
so, as the stonemasons did not want tobreak the holy law forbidding the depiction of people (it was considered as an arrogant attempt to imitate God’s work).

### Klausen  Synagogue (Klausova synagoga)

Before we begin with the tour of the synagogue, we ought to clarify why it takes the name „Klausen”. It can be explained in two ways. According to the first 
version, the name is derived from the German word “Klause” a small building. The other interpretation refers to three clauses, i.e. three functions – the synagogue, 
a hospital and a bathhouse. The original synagogue was built on an additionally purchased plot in 1573 by then Czech Primate Mordecai Meisel (czech: Mordechaj Maisel), 
however it succumbed to great fire in 1689. Thanks to Solomon Chalis Cohen a new tabernacle was built in 1694 and it became the largest and the Klaus Synagogue second 
major synagogue of Prague Jewish Community. The building underwent further reconstruction in 1880s.

The major feature of the synagogue is a richly stucco decorated vault. The synagogue consists of a main building and two annexes. As you could have already noticed, 
nearly all windows have semicircular finish. Unfortunately, the original Baroque vaults preserved just in the main hall. Please, look at the east face where you can see 
a distinctive and interesting element a triangular gable with Commandment Tablets at the post and an inscription tablet from the late 17th century. Regrettably, religious
service is not held here at present, nevertheless, the synagogue houses a permanent exhibition of Jewish Museum called Jewish Customs and Traditions.

### Jewish Ceremonial Hall – Building of Prague Burial Society

The Ceremonial hall of the Prague Jewish Burial Society was built for the last service to the deceased members of the Prague Jewish Community. It is used as an exhibition space administered by the Jewish Museum in Prague. The building is an excellent example of Romanesque Revival architecture.

The present Ceremonial Hall has replaced an older building serving the same purpose. It was constructed by A. Gabriel and J. Gerstel between 1906 and 1908. Its appearance, including the details like the bases and capitals of columns, the grille and the door, holds to the Romanesque Revival style. As long as the Prague chevra kadisha (Jewish Burial Society) used the space, the morgue was in the basement, on the first floor there was a room for the ritual purification of the dead (taharah) and on the second floor there was a meeting room, where the Society held its meetings as well as annual banquets. Since World War I the Burial Society has not used the hall for its original purpose. In 1926 the Society rented the building to the Jewish Museum in Prague, which has used it ever since.

The exposition which was opened there at the time is linked with the original usage of the space, introducing visitors to Jewish rituals held over the dying and the deceased (thus the exposition about the important milestones of Jewish life from the Klausen Synagogue is continued there), providing them with information about the Old Jewish Cemetery and other cemeteries in the Czech lands and the institution of the Prague Jewish Burial Society.

An important monument left by the Burial Society to posterity is a cycle of fifteen paintings, depicting rituals and customs performed by the Burial Society. An anonymous author fulfilled the order of the Society from around the year 1772 and followed the Baroque painting style. However, the motive of the Society, which hired him, originated probably from the new, enlightened, age: in keeping with the enlightened ideology it was supposed to show an important social role, which the Society had maintained for centuries. The paintings also depict the final period of the history of the Old Jewish Cemetery which makes the cycle more valuable.

### Old New Synagogue (Staronová synagoga)

The Old-New Synagogue dating back to the late 13th century used to be the Jewish community’as main place of worship. It is one of the oldest and most beautiful Gothic buildings in Prague, and the oldest synagogue in Europe. It is made up of a doublenaved hall divided by pillars on which rests unique fiveribbed vaulting. In the centre of the synagogue stands 
the pulpit behind a 15thcentury iron grille and surrounded by pews for eminent members of the Jewish community. Notice pew number one, above which is the Star of David. It was here
that the legendary Rabbi Low, creator of the Golem, used to sit. The most important place in the whole Synagogue is the bimah which faces east and contains the Torah – the five books 
of Moses. For Jews, the Torah is something sacred; those who read from it may not touch it with their hands, but use a silver pointer instead. At the beginning of the 14th century
an entrance hall was added to the synagogue housing two treasuries for tax collectors. Both brick gable ends were also added at this time. To pass from the entrance hall into the
main hall of the synagogue one goes through one of the oldest entrances in Prague. 

The tympanum (space above the entrance) is decorated with a relief of vine leaves and grapes. This decoration symbolises the 12 tribes of Israel as branches of one bush. This 
synagogue is steeped in legends. The most famous of these, the subject of several films, is the Golem a monster created by Rabbi Bezael Low. The Golem was made of clay and did all 
the work in the rabbi’s household. Rabbi Low brought him to life by placing a small roll of parchment with a sacred text written on it called a Shem under the Golem’s tongue, 
after which he acquired enormous strength and inexhaustible energy. He remained in that state until the Shem was removed. The Old-New Synagogue is the only synagogue in Prague where services still take place.

### High Synagogue and Jewish  Town Hall (Vysoká synagoga a Židovská radnice)

The High Synagogue, which can be found directly opposite the Old-New Synagogue, was built at the same time as the Jewish Town Hall next door by Mordechai Maisel in the second half of the 16th century. The Italian architect Pankrac Roder designed the building. The High Synagogue was originally linked to the town hall by an entrance on the 1st floor, and served as a meeting place for the Jewish community and representatives of the Jewish Town. However, this entrance was bricked up at the end of the 19th century and a new one created in Červena Street. The Renaissance building now houses an exhibition of 16th - 19th century synagogue textiles from the Jewish Museum.

### Maisel Synagogue (Maiselova synagoga)

The Maisel synagogue was erected in 1592 on the basis of a privilege granted by Emperor Rudolf II. Its founder was Mordecai Maisel, the Mayor of the Prague Jewish Town.

Built by Judah Tzoref de Herz and Josef Wahl, it was 

The construction of the synagogue was initiated by Mordechai Maisel, the Mayor of the Prague Jewish Town. In 1590, this renowned businessman and benefactor of the ghetto gained the building site. One year later he obtained from the emperor Rudolf II, the current sovereign of the country, a privilege to build his own synagogue. Mordecai Maisel had an important position at Rudolf's court and that probably helped him to gain this favour. The architectural plan for Maisel synagogue, designed by Judah Coref de Herz, was realized by Josef Wahl 
as a Renaissance temple with three naves, which was unusual for its day. In 1592, on Simchat Torah, the synagogue was consecrated. For the next century it became the largest and most impressive building in the ghetto, also thanks to its abundant equipment. Maisel bequeathed the synagogue to the Prague Jewish community, yet after his death in 1601 all his 
possession, including the synagogue, was confiscated (in spite of another imperial privilege, allowing Maisel to write a testament). Maisel's last will was therefore fulfilled 
entirely only after a number of trials, several decades later.

In 1689 the synagogue was severely damaged by fire that affected the whole ghetto. It was reconstructed in a hurry and lost one third of its length. Then it was changed in the 19th century (in 1862–1864 according to architectural plan of J. W. Wertmüller) and again at the turn of the 20th century when all the Jewish Quarter went through a big urban renewal. Architect Alfred Grotte reconstructed the synagogue in Neo-Gothic style.

During the Nazi occupation of the Czech lands, properties of the Czech Jewish communities were stored in Maisel Synagogue. After the World War II the synagogue became a depository of Jewish Museum in Prague. During the sixties it was restored and between 1965 and 1988 an exposition of silver Judaica was located there. Then the synagogue was closed because of deplorable technical conditions, which could not be improved because of lack of financial means. Velvet revolution made necessary reconstruction possible and the synagogue was then opened for visitors in 1996, showing an exposition of Jewish history in the Czech lands from the beginning (9th century) till the age of Enlightenment which meant a turning point in Jewish social status. After the recent restoration of Maisel Synagogue, this exposition has been updated (modern and interactive elements added), its topic, however, has remained the same.

### Spanish Synagogue(Španělská synagoga)

The youngest synagogue of the Prague´s Jewish Town Josefov was built at the crossroads of the streets Dušní and Vězeňská between 1867-68. Just like some other synagogues this one
was built in the Moorish style according to the project of Ignác Ullmann and Josef Niklas. The construction was performed in place of the former oldest synagogue called The Old School
or „Templ“ which according to the extant historical sources existed already in the 12th century. It was called „school“ because the synagogues used to serve as educational institutes
for the inhabitans of the Jewish community. And why is it actually called „Spanish“? There was an expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Isabella of Castile in the 15th century and
after their departure from their original homeland a small part of them settled down in Prague. They received the mentioned school to be their sanctuary which got the name „the Spanish synagogue“ after being settled by the Spaniards.

The synagogue itself is two storeys high. Its ground plan is square. The main hall with a dome is surrounded by three built-in balconies. At the south balcony, there is an organ. In the eastern wall there is a great round stained glass window with a central ornament of Magen David (hexagram), installed in 1882–1883. Underneath it there is a monumental aron ha-kodesh (Torah ark). The most impressive decorative element in the synagogue is a gilded and multi-colored parquet arabesque.
